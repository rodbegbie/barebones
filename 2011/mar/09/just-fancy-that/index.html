remote those might be.  Even if these attacks are difficult to be accomplished it gives the 
bad guys a leg up on research they would not have to do and encourages bad behavior.</blockquote>

                <p>Gary: Not the same. The &quot;vulnerability&quot; in question is bullshit (the info you can capture is no more than what you can see when you hold the credit card), and pointing out that Verifone is doing a 180 on their own stated policy is different from publicizing an exploit (which is what they claim they did, even though they&#39;re lying through their teeth).</p>

                <p>VeriFone is being disingenuous in that the problem is inherent in mag stripe cards. I can get the tapehead of a 3.5mm-&gt;cassette convertor and use it to read data off the three different tracks on a Credit Card.</p>

<p>The data is not encrypted on the credit card, not only that but getting credit card readers is extremely simple, making it look like a legitimate scanner is even simpler, not like the consumer really pays much attention.</p>

<p>It is very much a competitor quacking in their boots because someone else has come up with something and done it better at a lower cost.</p>

                <p>You can buy mag strip readers from any number of places, including Amazon. None of them encrypt the data as it comes off the card, any more than Square&#39;s does; most of them just emulate a USB keyboard.</p>

                <p>As per the least expensive magnetic strip reader on amazon: &quot;Simply plug reader into USB port of your computer and you good to go! No software to install! When connected to the host computer as a keyboard wedge, the reader is completely compatible with the host&#39;s software. The decoded data appears to the host as if it were entered manually by the operator through the keyboard.&quot;</p>
