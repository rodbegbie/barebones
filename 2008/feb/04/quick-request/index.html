        <h4>A quick request to any readers who are registered voters in the twenty-two states that are having Democratic primaries tomorrow</h4>
        <p><strong>Please vote for <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/" title="Barack Obama | Change We Can Believe In | Home">Barack Obama</a>.</strong></p>

<p>As you may have noticed from my links and tweets, I&#8217;m supporting Obama this year.  The reasons are many, but primarily it&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve had eight years of a horribly divisive presidency, and I believe this country (and the world) needs a leader who can bring people together, rather than split them further apart.  (Hillary Clinton is a fine person and a skilled politician, and I will support her if she gets the Democratic nomination, but she gathers as much loathing from some people in this country as I feel towards Bush and Cheney)</p>

<p><strong>Every vote counts.</strong>  All Democratic primaries tomorrow are assigning delegates through proportional-ish representation (unlike the Republicans, whose primaries are mostly first-past-the-post winner-takes-all affairs).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still disenfranchised in the US, despite having lived here since 1998.  All I can do is ask others to vote.  <strong>If you have any reservations about voting for Obama</strong>, <a href="http://groovymother.com/about/contact/">email or IM me</a>&#8212;I&#8217;ll see if I can do anything to change your mind.</p>

<p>My application for citizenship is in the mail, and there&#8217;s a decent chance that I might be a US citizen in November.  Nothing would make me prouder than getting to vote for Obama in my first presidential election.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

                <p>Hear hear.</p>

<p>Never before have I been so interested in a US election.</p>

<p>Thank jeebus Giuliani&#39;s out. Although it seems the GOP are gunning (gettit?) for the next-best warmonger in the list. Strange, since most of McCain&#39;s cred seems to stem from his suffering due to war.</p>

<p>Obama 08 is Blair in 97: someone who transcends the political agenda of his party and offers a grander vision.</p>

<p>That said, it was Blair who dragged us kicking and screaming into Iraq. Shame we didn&#39;t get any no-bid contracts out of it.</p>
