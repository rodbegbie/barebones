        <a title="groovymother :: February 09, 2003 - February 15, 2003 archives" href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/week_2003_02_09.html#000546">Daryn</a> just got back to me.  SpamArrest have posted an apology on their front page:

<blockquote>
<p><b>Spam Arrest Apologizes</b></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently we have received some inquiries regarding a mailing we delivered to some verified users of Spam Arrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>While this contact was completely covered by our privacy policy, our customers concerns come first.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of this, Spam Arrest has ceased sending such solicitation and will not send unsolicited bulk email again. Spam Arrest apologies for any inconvenience this action may have caused anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still hope they rot in hell for ever thinking this was a good idea, but I&#8217;ll stop forwarding him my spam.  On Monday.</p>

        <h4>Time is Relative</h4>
        <p>Lots of people blogging bitching out that <a title="Wired News: What Symantec Knew But Didn't Say" href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,57676,00.html">Symantec knew that Slammer was coming</a>.  This stems from a <a title="Symantec Unveils Global Early Warning System for Internet Attacks" href="http://www.symantec.com/press/2003/n030212.html">press release</a> put out by Symantec this morning.</p>

<p>From the Wired News article (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Within 10 minutes of debuting at 5:30 a.m. (UTC) Jan. 25 (<strong>9:30 p.m. <span class="caps">PST</span>, Jan. 24</strong>), the worm was observed to have infected more than 75,000 vulnerable hosts,&#8221; the researchers&#8217; report read in part.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Symantec spokesman Yunsun Wee, Symantec issued an alert about Slammer to DeepSight Threat Management System subscribers &#8220;at approximately <strong>9 p.m. <span class="caps">PST</span></strong> on Friday, Jan. 24.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the rest of the Internet didn&#8217;t spot Slammer until shortly after <strong>midnight <span class="caps">EST</span></strong> on Saturday, Jan. 25th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So apparently &#8220;the rest of the Internet&#8221; didn&#8217;t see Slammer until &#8220;midnight <acronym title="Eastern Standard Time"><span class="caps">EST</span></acronym>&#8221;.  Symantec knew about it at &#8220;9pm <acronym title="Pacific Standard Time"><span class="caps">PST</span></acronym>&#8221;.  So&#8230; that would be exactly the same time then. (0500 <acronym title="Universal Time Coordinate"><span class="caps">UTC</span></acronym>)</p>

<p>The real problem here is that Symantec are boasting that they gave their customers a whole 40 minutes notice of a problem.  At midnight.  On a Friday night.  Woo!  Sign me up for that service.</p>

        <p>Since I&#8217;m posting so much about spam today, I might as well publicise the fact that my long-time mailbox saviour, <a title="SpamAssassin: Welcome to SpamAssassin" href="http://spamassassin.taint.org/">SpamAssassin</a> , is now available in a shiny new relatively-easy-to-use <a title="Bloomba.home" href="http://www.bloomba.com/saproxy/">free Windows flavour</a>.</p>

        <h4>Revenge, Spam, etc.</h4>
        <p>Following my <a title="groovymother :: Revenge is a Dish Best Served with Spam" href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/000545.html">my earlier post</a>, an update on the situation.</p>

<p>First, Daryn replied from a different account (<a href="mailto:daryn@marinated.org">daryn@marinated.org</a>):</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Subject: Spam violation, washington state

<p>Rod, <br />
 <br />
Please do not forward your spam to Spam Arrest. We are a washington state company,<br />
and as such, can take legal action against you for this.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
 <br />
Daryn <br />
Spam Arrest</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>However, I&#8217;ve checked the <a href="http://www.wa.gov/ago/junkemail/the_law.shtml">Washington state law</a> and don&#8217;t believe I crossed the line, since I had no way of knowing if Daryn himself was a resident of WA.</p></p>

<p>Then he mailed me again</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>rod,

<p>please remove me from your spam list.</p>

<p>As a washington state resident, if you do not honor my request, I can file a<br />
legal complaint against you.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Daryn</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Wrong again.  WA state law says nothing about honouring opt-out requests.  Only that you cannot a) forge the From address, b) forge a header or c) use a deceitful subject line.</p>

<p>Hmmm... An anti-spam firm who don't know anything about their local anti-spam laws?  Promising.</p>

<p>So the forwarding of spam will continue.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm not the <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=slrnb4m6bl.4hk.you%40jazz.hq.newdream.net&amp;rnum=1">only one</a> to be bothered by this spam, which means that SpamArrest's own mail servers are now <a href="http://relays.osirusoft.com/cgi-bin/rbcheck.cgi?addr=66.150.163.161">appearing</a> on <a href="http://spamcop.net/w3m?action=checkblock&amp;ip=66.150.163.149">various </a> <a href="http://www.trustic.com/ip?ip=66.150.163.149&amp;Find=Find">blacklists</a>.  Not a good sign for an anti-spam service.</p>

        <h4>Revenge is a Dish Best Served with Spam</h4>
        <p>This morning, I opened up my email and surfed through a mailing list I frequent.  I was surprised to find a spam email waiting for me in the folder:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Subject: ADV: Enjoy a spam-free inbox

<p>You may remember recently sending an email to a Spam Arrest customer,<br />
and receiving a response asking you to visit our website and type in<br />
a word that was shown to you in a picture.</p>

<p>It was pretty easy, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Did you know that that one simple step stops virtually all spam from<br />
entering our customers&#8217; inboxes?</p>

<p>You too can enjoy the benefits of a spam-free inbox.</p>

<p>We are so confident you&#8217;ll like our product, that we&#8217;d like to offer<br />
you a 30-Day free trial. If you are un-satisfied for any reason, just<br />
cancel your account before the end of the trial and you&#8217;ll pay nothing.</p>

<p>Click here to visit our website and start your trial:</p>

<p><a href="http://spamarrest.com/affl?1980401">http://spamarrest.com/affl?1980401</a></p>

<p>Spam Arrest<br />
Take control of your inbox!</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Yes, that's right -- An unsolicited email advertising a spam-trapping service.</p>

<p>The reason I received this email is because one of the subscribers to the mailing list had subscribed to SpamArrest's service.  Because I got annoying messages every time I mailed the list asking me to "validate myself", I eventually succumbed and went through the validation process.  And because I validated myself, SpamArrest now think I'm fair game to receive their advertising messages.</p><p>I emailed spamarrest at privacy@spamarrest.com, ccing pr@spamarrest.com for good measure:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>In what way, shape or form, exactly, does this comply with your posted
<a href="http://www.spamarrest.com/privacy.jsp">Privacy Policy</a>?

<p>I am absolutely sickened that an &#8220;anti-spam company&#8221;, of all people, is<br />
spamming &#8220;passers-by&#8221;.</p>

<p>I did not opt-in for your publicity material.</p>

<p>Kindly explain your actions before I start publicizing this case more.  (I<br />
think CNet and Wired News would love to make a story out of this)</p>

<p>rOD.</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>(I actually notified Wired News and CNet immediately.  Ironically, two CNet journalists use SpamArrest's service, so I got two "please verify yourself" messages back.  Needless to say, I didn't follow through.)</p>

<p>At 1.30pm, I received the following response:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Rod,

<p>Our privacy policy states that we are allowed to contact &#8220;senders&#8221;, that is,<br />
the people who send our customers email.</p>

<p>Please refer the section entitled &#8220;HOW DO WE <span class="caps">USE</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PERSONAL</span> <span class="caps">INFORMATION</span> WE<br />
<span class="caps">COLLECT</span>?&#8221;.</p>

<p>You may use the opt-out link in the email, or visit<br />
<a href="http://spamarrest.com/optout">http://spamarrest.com/optout</a> to remove yourself from receiving future<br />
promotional emails from us.</p>

<p>Daryn<br />
Spam Arrest</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Fair enough -- In summary, "If you email one of our customers, we are allowed to spam you".  So I replied:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Dear Daryn,

<p>In accordance with my posted privacy policy at<br />
<a href="http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html"><a href="http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html">http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html</a></a> I will now start forwarding spam I<br />
receive to you.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Love and hugs,</p>

<p>rOD.</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Daryn has since received a copy of every spam I have received for the month of February so far.  That's approximately 450 spams.  And he's been added to my reporting scripts for any spams I receive from here on in.</p>

<p>Awaiting further developments.</p>

        <h4>Why I Lurve The Inertnet</h4>
        <p>My admittedly slender grasp on sanity is, once more, kept intact by <A href="http://www.imdb.com/"><span class="caps">IMDB</span></a>.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I had a flashback to a sit-com I vaguely remembered from the early 90&#8217;s.  I asked Joy.  &#8220;What was the sitcom about a witch or something that featured <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Bohrer,%20Corinne">that woman</a> who played <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Guests?0108778">the girlfriend of Joey&#8217;s with the fruitbaskets</a>?&#8221;  Joy was no help.</p>

<p>Thankfully the inernet was: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0096589">Free Spirit</a>.  (Featuring <i>Alyson Hannigan</i>?!?)</p>

        <h4>Never Mind The Bootlegs</h4>
        <p>The Globe has an article about a potential new <a title="Boston Globe Online / Living | Arts / Instant live CDs of a concert? Testing to begin in Boston" href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/038/living/Instant_live_CDs_of_a_concert_Testing_to_begin_in_Boston .shtml">service for gig-goers</a> which could be rather groovy.</p>
