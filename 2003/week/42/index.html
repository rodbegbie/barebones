        <h4>For lovers of cute dogs and/or Berkeley Breathed</h4>
        <p>Yesterday, I excitedly IMed Joy to let her know that <a href="http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/opus_returns.html" title="Berkeley Breathed - Opus Returns">Berkeley Breathed&#8217;s new comic strip</a> starts next month.  She then IMed back a link to the <a href="http://www.twbookmark.com/features/flash/flaweddogs.html" title="Berkeley Breathed's Flawed Dog-o-Matic">Flawed Dog-o-Matic</a>, a fun promotional tool for his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316713597/groovymother-20/ref%3Dnosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Flawed Dogs: The Year End Leftovers at the Piddleton Last Chance Dog Pound">Flawed Dogs</a>.</p>

<p>I then picked up a copy of the book on the way home, and blow me if it isn&#8217;t bloody brilliant. A mix of warpedly-cute puppies and odd, funny poetry.  From the <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/gic_LuluLG.html" title="The Official Berkeley Breathed Website">accessorized Lulu</a> to the <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/gic_PepeLG.html" title="The Official Berkeley Breathed Website">Richard Gere look-a-like Pepe</a></p>

<p>So brilliant is it, in fact, that Joy &amp; I decided to spend $150 of wedding gift money on a <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/item-detail.cfm?ID=GIC-01&amp;storeid=1" title="Cool Stuff of Berkeley's to Buy: RosebudEnterprises: Item Detail">signed gicl&eacute;e print of Rollo</a>, combining, as it does, two of my favourite things in the world:  Bassett hounds and Nuns.  It will look totally handsome on our walls, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

        <h4>Trailer Park</h4>
        <p>I managed to make it through <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/18/saturday_night_a.html" title="groovymother :: Saturday Night at the Movies. and Friday Night. and Saturday Afternoon. and...">all five movies</a> at the weekend.  You can read reviews of them <a href="http://www.checkthegrid.com/" title="CheckTheGrid.com">elsewhere</a>, so all I&#8217;ll say is that they&#8217;re all worth seeing.  Oh, and &#8220;Go <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1288436/" title="Zabeth Russell">Zabs</a>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I <strong>did</strong> see a lot of trailers.  Some more than once.  One of them, five sodding times.  So here are my reviews of <em>all of them</em>, beginning with the genre I have nothing but loathing for&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Historical Epics</strong></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Actors seem to think that they can just clinch an Oscar by making a historical epic.  They don&#8217;t seem to realise that we&#8217;re all just fucking sick of historical epics.&#8221;</em>&#8212;Joy, after seeing Tom Cruise&#8217;s face in the trailer for The Last Samurai.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/master_and_commander/" title="Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</a>&#8212;I cannot say enough bad things about this trailer.  It preceded every movie this weekend, and by the end, I was doing Rocky Horror-style call &amp; response with Mr Crowe.  It&#8217;s Historical!  Epic!  Worthy!  And really dull looking.  Like Titanic, but without Kate Winslett&#8217;s breasts.  Besides, I could never watch a movie featuring such appalling hair as is sported in this trailer.  (And what is up with the massive <span class="caps">URL</span>? (<a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/"><a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/">http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/</a></a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/the_alamo/" title="The Alamo">The Alamo</a>&#8212;The same movie as Master and Commander, but with less water.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/the_last_samurai/" title="The Last Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>&#8212;I grew bored of this trailer before it had started.  I can remember nothing about it.  Not a good sign.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look like they should be worth $10</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/love_actually/" title="Love Actually">Love Actually</a>&#8212;I liked <span class="caps">FWAAF</span> and Notting Hill, and this looks pretty danged good too.  I also admire the restraint of the trailer&#8217;s editor, who only gives a brief glimpse of Rowan Atkinson, when you just <em>know</em> that he&#8217;s going to deliver some scene-stealing performances.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/elf/" title="Elf">Elf</a>&#8212;Will Ferrell rocks.  Jon Favreau rocks.  This movie looks great.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/BadSanta-10001275/preview.php">Bad Santa(Bad Santa (2003): Billy Bob Thornton, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham, Terry Zwigoff)</a>&#8212;I&#8217;ve heard almost nothing about this film, but it looks like it could be a winner.  A nice R-rated comedy from the director of Ghost World, starring Billy-Bob Thornton as a thieving drunken Santa.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Could go either way</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/along_came_polly/" title="Apple - Trailers - Along Came Polly">Along Came Polly</a>&#8212;On the upside, the blind ferret.  On the downside, Jennifer Aniston.  Ah, the blind ferret/Jennifer Aniston trade-off happens once again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/scary_movie_3/trailer.html" title="Apple - Trailers - Scary Movie 3">Scary Movie 3</a>&#8212;Yes, the first two movies were shit, but this one&#8217;s directed by David Zucker.  The trailer has some classic bits of <span class="caps">ZAZ</span> slapstick, but seems to rely heavily of current cultural references (Simon Cowell, &#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221;) which will age badly (just look at the &#8220;Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home&#8221; line in Airplane.  Apparently that&#8217;s a reference to a coffee commercial of the day)</li>
<li><a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_cmp/trailers_rev_frames.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix Revolutions</a>&#8212;I really must get around to watching the second one first.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that I will drag Joy to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/looneytunesbackinaction/" title="Looney Tunes Back In Action">Looney Tunes Back In Action</a>&#8212;So sue me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/paycheck/" title="Apple - Trailers - Paycheck">Paycheck</a>&#8212;Because Ben Affleck action flicks are pretty decent if you hand your brain in at the door.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that Joy will drag me to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/timeline/" title="index">Timeline</a>&#8212;Apparently Joy enjoyed the book, but she &#8220;had real problems with the underlying physics&#8221;.  Ah, I&#8217;ve married a smartie.  Also amusing that Richard Donner is billed as &#8220;The Director of Lethal Weapon&#8221;, as if he&#8217;s done nothing else in the 16 years between.  Well, I suppose &#8220;From the director of Scrooged&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t have gone over so well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/houseofsandandfog.html" title="Apple - Trailers - House of Sand and Fog">House of Sand and Fog</a>&#8212;Sadly not titled &#8220;House of Fog and Sand&#8221;, cause then I could make some witty pun about &#8220;Bag of Fuckin&#8217; Shite, more like&#8221;.  But it isn&#8217;t, so I can&#8217;t.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/cheaperbythedozen/" title="Cheaper By The Dozen">Cheaper By The Dozen</a>&#8212;Because Joy has a Bonnie Hunt thing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>No!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/the_missing/" title="The Missing">The Missing</a>&#8212;Blah.  Discussion in cinema after seeing the words &#8220;Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones&#8221; on screen:  Me: &#8220;What did Tommy Lee Jones win an Oscar for?&#8221;  Joy:  &#8220;Dunno.  The Fugitive?&#8221;  Me: &#8220;Men in Black II?&#8221;  Joy: &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it have been cool if they&#8217;d promoted <span class="caps">MIB</span> II as starring Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones and Oscar Nominee Will Smith?&#8221;  That conversation was more interesting than this trailer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/returnoftheking/" title="The Return Of The King">The Lord of the Rings <span class="caps">III</span></a>&#8212;I didn&#8217;t go see the first two, and have no desire to see this one either.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/filmseries/" title="SUNDANCE CHANNEL">Sundance Film Series</a>&#8212;Trailers for Die Mommie Die and Dopamime.  Just because they&#8217;re indie doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t suck big donkeys cocks in hell forever.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The best danged thing to precede the actual movie</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The new &#8220;switch off your cellphones&#8221; announcement featuring <a href="http://www.bbdoatl.com/work_cing.html" title="[ BBDO ATLANTA ]">Inconsiderate Cellphone Man</a>.  &#8221;<em>Mauled</em> by a <em>tiger</em>?&#8221;.  Made me laugh every time I saw it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The worst, most patronising insult-to-the-intelligence piece-of-crap to precede the movie</strong></p>

        <h4>Bye! Well done! Here&#8217;s a horse for you.  As per usual.</h4>
        <p>I read a report the other day that, in producing iTunes for Windows, <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7298_16-5092603.html?tag=adts" title="ZDNet AnchorDesk: New Apple iTunes: Digital hub or digital flub?">&#8220;Apple has given the world one less reason to buy a Mac&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s completely wrong.</p>

<p>The iPod has been referred to as <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2002/04/03/ipod/" title="BusinessWeek: iPod could be 'Trojan horse' into Wintel">Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Trojan horse&#8217;</a> into the Windows world&#8212;That by making a highly visible, highly desirable piece of technology available to Windows users, they might show how great Apple design is, and create a few <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/" title="Apple - Switch">switchers</a>.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s true.  I was such a switcher.</p>

<p>My first Mac was purchased second-hand for $500 about a month after I got my first iPod, back in January 2002.  I was so impressed with the design, that I wanted to know more about what Apple was up to.  I&#8217;d seen the pretty pictures of OS X, and photos of the <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=g4cube" title="www.apple-history.com / gallery / g4cube">cube</a>, but hadn&#8217;t paid that much attention.  But the iPod was so neat, so beautiful, so ingeniously designed, that I had to know more.  The Mac impressed me so much that 9 months later, I splashed out close to $2,000 on a shiny new Power Mac G4, which I love very much.</p>

<p>And I copied all my MP3s over into iTunes, and all my photos into iPhoto, and bought a digital camcorder so I could use iMovie, and a bluetooth cellphone so I could use iSync, and just generally put the Mac at the centre of my, oh yes, digital hub.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs had me at &#8220;iPo&#8221;.</p>

<p>But there was a fly in the proverbial ointment.  While the iPod was delightful, the user experience on the PC was hellish.  When I first got my iPod, there was no &#8220;Windows iPod&#8221;&#8212;it was meant to be Mac only.  Your choices if you owned a PC were to either use the buggy-as-all-hell crash-your-iPod-and-render-it-useless beta of <a href="http://www.macdrive.com/products/xplay/" title="Mediafour Corporation Products">XPlay</a> or the buggy-as-a-little-bit-of-hell usability-is-for-lusers <a href="http://www.ephpod.com/">EphPod(EphPod &#8211; iPod for Windows (and Linux!))</a>.  While loading MP3s into my iPod for the first time with XPlay, it fucked up my iPod so badly it wouldn&#8217;t boot up.  I spent three days with a $400 doorstop until I could find a friend with a Mac who could wipe and restore it for me before I heard a damned note from the thing.</p>

<p>Then the Windows iPod was released, bundled with MusicMatch.  An improvement, sure.  But still a pretty crappy experience all round.  I&#8217;ve played with MusicMatch briefly, and hated it.  As I <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/16/itunes_for_windo.html" title="groovymother :: iTunes for Windows">mentioned the other day</a>, in the 4 months my wife has had her iPod, we didn&#8217;t manage to successfully sync it to her PC!</p>

<p>By releasing iTunes for Windows, Apple now control the user experience from top to bottom.  You buy music at the iTunes Music Store, organise it in iTunes and download it to your iPod&#8212;Just like on the Mac.  Now all PC users can get to experience the <em>full</em> Apple effect.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#8217;ll see what they&#8217;re missing.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;ll convince them to walk into the Apple Store and see the swishness of the other iApps.</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s a chance a few more people might be loading a lovely new impulse-bought iMac into their car and driving it home.</p>

<p>Which, I think, was the point all along.</p>
