        <h4>Revenge is a Dish Best Served with Spam</h4>
        <p>This morning, I opened up my email and surfed through a mailing list I frequent.  I was surprised to find a spam email waiting for me in the folder:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Subject: ADV: Enjoy a spam-free inbox

<p>You may remember recently sending an email to a Spam Arrest customer,<br />
and receiving a response asking you to visit our website and type in<br />
a word that was shown to you in a picture.</p>

<p>It was pretty easy, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Did you know that that one simple step stops virtually all spam from<br />
entering our customers&#8217; inboxes?</p>

<p>You too can enjoy the benefits of a spam-free inbox.</p>

<p>We are so confident you&#8217;ll like our product, that we&#8217;d like to offer<br />
you a 30-Day free trial. If you are un-satisfied for any reason, just<br />
cancel your account before the end of the trial and you&#8217;ll pay nothing.</p>

<p>Click here to visit our website and start your trial:</p>

<p>Spam Arrest<br />
Take control of your inbox!</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Yes, that's right -- An unsolicited email advertising a spam-trapping service.</p>

<p>The reason I received this email is because one of the subscribers to the mailing list had subscribed to SpamArrest's service.  Because I got annoying messages every time I mailed the list asking me to "validate myself", I eventually succumbed and went through the validation process.  And because I validated myself, SpamArrest now think I'm fair game to receive their advertising messages.</p><p>I emailed spamarrest at privacy@spamarrest.com, ccing pr@spamarrest.com for good measure:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>In what way, shape or form, exactly, does this comply with your posted
<a href="http://www.spamarrest.com/privacy.jsp">Privacy Policy</a>?

<p>I am absolutely sickened that an &#8220;anti-spam company&#8221;, of all people, is<br />
spamming &#8220;passers-by&#8221;.</p>

<p>I did not opt-in for your publicity material.</p>

<p>Kindly explain your actions before I start publicizing this case more.  (I<br />
think CNet and Wired News would love to make a story out of this)</p>

<p>rOD.</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>(I actually notified Wired News and CNet immediately.  Ironically, two CNet journalists use SpamArrest's service, so I got two "please verify yourself" messages back.  Needless to say, I didn't follow through.)</p>

<p>At 1.30pm, I received the following response:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Rod,

<p>Our privacy policy states that we are allowed to contact &#8220;senders&#8221;, that is,<br />
the people who send our customers email.</p>

<p>Please refer the section entitled &#8220;HOW DO WE <span class="caps">USE</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PERSONAL</span> <span class="caps">INFORMATION</span> WE<br />
<span class="caps">COLLECT</span>?&#8221;.</p>

<p>You may use the opt-out link in the email, or visit<br />
<a href="http://spamarrest.com/optout">http://spamarrest.com/optout</a> to remove yourself from receiving future<br />
promotional emails from us.</p>

<p>Daryn<br />
Spam Arrest</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Fair enough -- In summary, "If you email one of our customers, we are allowed to spam you".  So I replied:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Dear Daryn,

<p>In accordance with my posted privacy policy at<br />
<a href="http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html"><a href="http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html">http://arsecandle.org/~rod/daryn.html</a></a> I will now start forwarding spam I<br />
receive to you.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Love and hugs,</p>

<p>rOD.</pre></blockquote></p></p>

<p>Daryn has since received a copy of every spam I have received for the month of February so far.  That's approximately 450 spams.  And he's been added to my reporting scripts for any spams I receive from here on in.</p>

<p>Awaiting further developments.</p>
