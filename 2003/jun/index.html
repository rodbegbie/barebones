        <h4>EFFecting Change</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.eff.org/" title="EFF: Homepage"><span class="caps">EFF</span></a> has launched a <a href="http://www.eff.org/share/" title="EFF: Tired of Being Treated Like a Criminal?">new campaign promoting alternatives</a> that the music industry might like to consider instead of <a href="http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/062503.asp" title="Recording Industry Association of America">unleashing lawsuits upon their customers</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been put-off joining the <span class="caps">EFF</span> in the past, due to run-ins on various mailing lists and bulletin boards with the <a href="http://www.perkel.com/" title="Marc Perkel's Web Site">unbearably clueless, shouty fuckwit</a> who works as their sysadmin.  Despite that, I&#8217;ve finally put some money where my mouth is and joined.  And now I have a new line to fill in on my <a href="http://www.immigration.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-140.htm" title="BCIS Form I-140">I-140</a> when they ask what political groups I&#8217;ve been a member of!  What fun!</p>

        <h4>Art for Art&#8217;s Sake</h4>
        <p>Three DVDs are being released in September collecting together <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bb/feature/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1924246" title="BILLBOARD">music videos directed by Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry</a>.  This excites me hugely.</p>

<p>For me, the four minute music video is one of the finest examples of 20th century art.  What the hey, let&#8217;s throw what little we&#8217;ve seen of the 21st century too.  Four minutes to convey an emotion, tell a story, burn an image into the soul of the viewer, and, perhaps as an afterthought, shift a few records at the same time.  Your soundtrack is pre-made; all that&#8217;s left is for you to build your visuals around it.</p>

<p>Watching an excellent video can fill me with the same emotions as staring at an excellent painting (and equally, a piss-poor video fills me with the same emotions as staring at a poster in the window of McDonalds), so I&#8217;m obviously thrilled at the possibility of forking out for a <span class="caps">DVD</span> and getting to add some art to my shelves.</p>

        <h4>I &#8217;Scrobble.  Do you?</h4>
        <p>Don&#8217;t know how I missed this for so long, but I&#8217;ve been playing with the very fun-looking (and superbly-named) <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/index.php" title="Audioscrobbler.com :: Discover new music based on your listening habits">Audioscrobbler</a>.  Create an account, download a plugin for your MP3 player of choice, and watch the website keep track of your MP3 playing.  Once it has enough data, it&#8217;ll start recommending bands to you based on the tastes of you, and the &#8217;scrobbler community at large.</p>

<p>You can now get a glimpse into <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=top10&amp;file=userinfo&amp;user=rODbegbie" title="Audioscrobbler.com :: Discover new music based on your listening habits">what&#8217;s been played on all my collected PCs</a>, instead of the list on this site (which only tracks my iTunes usage at home).</p>

<p>Now, if I can only find some way to hack iTunes to upload what I&#8217;ve been listening to when I sync up my iPod&#8230;.</p>

        <h4>Voldemort Comment-Spamming?</h4>
        <p>Just received an email notifying me that someone had left comments on <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2002/05/09/order_of_the_pho.html" title="groovymother :: Order of the Phoenix">an entry I wrote last year</a> (BIG <span class="caps">NOTE</span>:  If you&#8217;re currently reading, or planning to read, the new Harry Potter book, then don&#8217;t click through, as it reveals who dies).</p>

<p>Now, far be it for me to suggest that the author of the comment is not a regular reader of this fine website, but a thorough discussion of the plot of the book being attached to a post barely mentioning the title seems a smidge out of place.  SImilarly <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2002/05/09/jesus_power_810.html" title="groovymother :: Jesus Power: 8/10">this comment attached to a post</a> which is in no way related to the good wizardkid, bar containing a link to the previous entry.</p>

<p>It would seem that people are comment-spamming onto posts about H. Potter.  But unlike <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2002/11/comment_spam_evolving.php" title="phil ringnalda dot com: Comment spam evolving?">previous comment-spams</a>, there&#8217;s no link in the comment, bar a Yahoo/Hotmail email address.  Anyone got any suppositions as to the purpose and/or origins of these spams?  Proofs of Concept?  Email harvesting from replies to the webmail addresses?</p>

        <h4>Feeling Hot Hot Hot!</h4>
        <p>Rummage through your MP3 collections, for it&#8217;s time for the <a href="http://www.neuroticfishbowl.com/archives/002311.html" title="Neurotic Fishbowl: Burn It - The Summer Edition">summer CD swap</a>.  Make a mix-CD and mail it out to three strangers.  In return, you get three discs back.  The theme is &#8220;Songs that make you hot&#8221;, which could make for some interesting compilations!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.laughatlantis.com/" title="LaughAtlantis">Joy</a> took part in this last time, and it looked like a lot of fun.</p>

        <h4>Do Not Call</h4>
        <p>About bloody time.  The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/donotcall/" title="Federal Trade Commission - The Do Not Call Registry">National Do Not Call Registry</a> has launched their <a href="http://donotcall.gov/" title="National Do Not Call Registry">registration site</a>.  Now you can tell telemarketers to piss off in advance.</p>

<p>The site is, unsurprisingly, somewhat swamped at the moment, but rather brilliantly, all numbers on the <a href="https://www.madonotcall.govconnect.com/Welcome.asp" title="Mass Office of Consumer Affairs - Do Not Call List Registry">Massachusetts Do Not Call List Registry</a> (which I&#8217;ve been on since Day 1) will be <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/06/dnc/ma.htm" title="Massachusetts Residents Get A Choice About Telemarketing Calls">automatically added to the federal list</a>.  Throw your <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~egbg/counterscript.html" title="anti-telemarketing EGBG counterscript">anti-telemarketing counterscript</a> away, and start answering the phone once more!</p>

        <p>The air conditioning is knackered in the office basement I work in.  It is currently 81&deg;F down here (that&#8217;s 27&deg;C to you civilised people in metric-speaking countries).  I keep disappearing into the server room, which is being kept at a balmy 65&deg;F.  I wonder if I can expense <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/accessories/5dee/" title="ThinkGeek :: Fly Fan USB Fan">one of these</a>?</p>

        <h4>&#8220;Female Problems&#8221;</h4>
        <p>After reading <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/000722.html" title="Yoz Grahame's Cheerleader: BRAAAIIINNM^HSS!">Yoz&#8217;s glowing review</a>, the other day, of <a href="http://www.empireinteractive.com/TTOD/" title="THE TYPING OF THE DEAD">The Typing of the Dead</a>, I had to give it a go.</p>

<p>I dropped $10 for a copy off of <a href="http://half.ebay.com/cat/buy/prod.cgi?cpid=1073936447&amp;domain_id=2266&amp;meta_id=5" title="Half.com: The Typing of the Dead">half.com</a>, and I have to say, it is the most insanely-fun shoot-em-up I&#8217;ve seen in a long-time.  My almost-total lack of hand-eye co-ordination makes me more than a little crap at action games, but my years of geeking in front of a monitor make me a pretty decent typist.  I had a fantastic time blowing the shit out of zombies with my typing prowess.  Highly, <em>highly</em> recommended.</p>

<p>(BTW, if you&#8217;re loosely-moraled, and run <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, you can nab a free copy from the good folks at <a href="http://www.bytemonsoon.com/details.php?id=730" title="Bytemonsoon - Details for torrent The Typing of the Dead PC - 550MB typing tutor/game Rated M for mature.">Bytemonsoon</a>)</p>

        <h4>Clue By Four!  Clue By Four!  CLUE BY FOUR!</h4>
        <p>Received an email this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found your web site,<br />
<a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/week_2002_10_20.html#000331"><a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/week_2002_10_20.html">http://www.groovymother.com/archives/week_2002_10_20.html</a></a> has a reference to<br />

term, and I am in the process of bringing that product to market.  My lawyers<br />
have told me that if you do not remove that reference, it dilutes my<br />
trademark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would much rather ask you politely to remove references to Clue-by-Four&#8482;<br />
than have an ugly lawyerese letter sent via certified mail, etc.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve given this a lot of thought, and here is my official opinion on the matter:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/clue-by-four.html" title="clue-by-four [The Jargon Dictionary]">Clue-by-four</a> is a well-known phrase, which pre-dates the trademark registration by many years.  Therefore, it should be considered a &#8220;generic term&#8221;.</li>
<li>Bite me.</li>
<li>If you seriously want the words removed from my website, pay your fucking lawyers, you cheap-ass bastard.</li>
<li>Good luck on removing all references to &#8220;clue-by-fours&#8221; from the many copies of the Jargon Dictionary distributed since <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg410.txt">12-Mar-1999</a> which would&#8230; oops&#8230; pre-date your trademark filing date of 18-Aug-1999.</li>
<li>No, seriously.  Bite me hard.</li>

        <h4>Take (Secure) AIM</h4>
        <p>The latest <a href="http://www.aim.com/get_aim/win/win_beta.adp" title="AOL Instant Messenger">beta version of <span class="caps">AIM</span></a> finally includes the ability to hold <a href="http://enterprise.aim.com/products/aim/personalcerts/" title="About AIM Personal Certificates">encrypted conversations</a> between suitably certified parties.</p>

<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s still a complete bugger to attempt to get going.  You have to jump through <a href="http://www.comodogroup.com/products/certificate_services/free_email.html" title="Comodo Group - Next Generation Digital Signature &amp; Trust Solutions">all manner of hoops</a> just to get a certificate, then there&#8217;s the pain of importing it into <span class="caps">AIM</span> through a not terribly useable interface.</p>

<p>Which is a shame, because more people should have access to this kind of thing; It should be one-click installable.  I have to go through a bunch of high-level geekery (gawd bless SSH(Secure Shell)) to encrypt all my web-surfing, emailing and IMing at work, because I don&#8217;t trust the corporate sysadmins not to be spying on what I&#8217;m up to.  (And any company that blocks <a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com/" title="FuckedCompany.com - Official lubricant of the new economy">FuckedCompany.com</a> at the firewall, can, quite frankly, go become a fucked company).</p>

        <h4>Cheating Fruit Machines</h4>
        <p>As a Geek of Computer Science, I often get curious about the software and algorithms behind things that most people take for granted.  For example, I&#8217;m fascinated by the logic employed by elevators to decide which lift to send to which floor when a button is pressed.  As I understand it, all kinds of factors are taken into account, such as time of day (in the morning, most elevators sit in the ground floor, ready to take people upstairs.  In the evening, they&#8217;re dotted around the building, so people can get home).</p>

<p>Fruit Machines are another one.  What logic is used to decide whether you&#8217;re a winner or a loser?  Well, the <a href="http://www.fairplay-campaign.co.uk/" title="FairPlay - Fighting for Fairer Gaming">FairPlay Campaign</a> has been doing some research, and noticed that, often, your gambles have <a href="http://www.fairplay-campaign.co.uk/fruit/" title="Cheating Fruit Machines">zero chance of paying off</a>.  And they&#8217;re going to do something about it, dagnammit.</p>

        <h4>The Indies are Coming</h4>
        <p>Derek at <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/" title="CD Baby: a little CD store with the best new independent music">CD Baby</a> has posted an excellent <a href="http://cdbaby.net/itunes" title="Apple iTunes + independent music">summary of the deal Apple are offering indie labels</a> regarding getting their music on sale in the iTunes Music Store.  I can&#8217;t wait for this to kick in.  Browsing is just going to get even more addictive!</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> Link is now down, but if you click on the &#8220;Read the rest of this story&#8221; link below, I&#8217;ve got a copy of the original text.(originally published at cdbaby.net)</p>

<p>I got an invitation to go to Apple&#8217;s office for a presentation/meeting today (June 5, 2003) about how to get independent artists into the iTunes Music Store. There were about 150 people there, representatives from the best independent record labels and music services, in this invitation-only conference room. Steve Jobs came out and started a two and a half hour presentation/seminar/Q&amp;A about iTunes and the benefits of independent labels making their music available there. I type fast and had my laptop, so I wrote down all the major points of their presentation as they went.</p>

<p><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: I&#8217;ve skipped the super-basic introduction to iTunes and what it does, because that can be found so many other places. This is the stuff that I felt was most important to musicians:<br />
The basics</p>

<ul>
<li>The basics of iTunes Music Store are covered in many places, so if you haven&#8217;t used iTunes Music store yet, read these links first:</li>
<li>Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music Store website.</li>
<li>Great video showing the service.</li>
<li><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: iTunes is not a website! It can only be accessed from the iTunes software run on Mac OS X (now) and Windows (by the end of the year.)</li>
<li>I highly suggest trying it for yourself. If you don&#8217;t have a Mac, use a friend&#8217;s. Enter your credit card info and actually buy a song. Tell it to store your info for future purchases. Buy a few more songs with the one-click system. I&#8217;m serious. You should try it yourself to really experience how amazingly cool it is.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re using a <span class="caps">DRM</span> called Fairplay to make sure you can&#8217;t put these songs on the internet and have them play on another player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Current Stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 6&#8211;7 million copies of iTunes in use.</li>
<li>3.5 million songs sold so far. Selling about 500,000 songs a week now.</li>
<li>More than 75% of songs have sold at least once. There is a wide breadth in purchasing. This is not only fueled by hits.</li>
<li>45% of all songs have been bought as an album. In other words: don&#8217;t worry about the death of the album format. 45% of people prefer to buy as an album anyway, even though they always have the option to only buy per-song.</li>
<li>90% of sales are 1-click downloads. (1-click is where customer has credit card stored on file, so that as soon as they click a song title, it starts downloading and their credit card is automatically charged.)</li>
<li>10 previews (free 30 second listen) for every purchase. Meaning: 10 listens per buy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Price of music on iTunes</p>

<ul>
<li>Songs must be 99 cents each.</li>
<li>Full albums are recommended to be $9.99 or lower.</li>
<li>Album price must be less than or equal to the sum of their tracks. So if you have a 5-song album, it can&#8217;t be more than $4.95 to buy the full-length album.</li>
<li>Apple strongly recommends going even lower than $9.99. They&#8217;d like to see that price drop to make the full-album purchase even more desirable.</li>
<li>Only exception: if a song is over 7 minutes long, they won&#8217;t offer it as a separate download. It will be available as part of the album only.</li>
<li>There is no cost to put your music on iTunes.</li>
<li>There will be no up-front advance from Apple.</li>
<li>Details on the wholesale price to the label will be mailed to us, later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sales report to SoundScan</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple is reporting all iTunes sales to SoundScan!</li>
<li>SoundScan measures per-song not per-album.</li>
<li>So if someone buys your whole album, each track on the album is reported as a song sale.</li>
<li>SoundScan requested to do it that way. It was their idea, not Apple&#8217;s.</li>
</ul>

<p>About positioning and getting attention on iTunes</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple has hired an editorial staff with backgrounds in music to decide what gets featured.</li>
<li>Editorial team makes decisions every day as to what goes where.</li>
<li>Big labels don&#8217;t get preferential treatment.</li>
<li>&#8220;We pick music we like, and we think everyone else is going to like.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of people offer money&#8221;, but Apple refuses money, and has no plan to ever accept money for placement.</li>
<li>Even what looks like a banner ad at the top of the screen is put there by Apple.</li>
<li>When an audience member doubted they&#8217;d stay with this policy, they pointed to their 20 years of selling Apple computers, and never selling icons on the desktop or any of the other things that companies have offered to pay them a lot of money to do.</li>
<li>(Plus Steve Jobs reminded us they have $41 billion in the bank and are not in debt. They&#8217;re not desparate for cash.)</li>
<li>They did admit that when a popular artist gives iTunes exclusive tracks, that may prompt Apple to make a banner an on iTunes promoting it.</li>
<li>New releases sell really well.</li>
<li>Exclusive tracks (songs that aren&#8217;t available on CD anywhere) sell amazingly well. They&#8217;re the best sellers in whole store.</li>
<li>Occasionally they make a special featured artist page, with video, photos, a link back to the artist&#8217;s site, and more. It seems this is just for very high-profile artists, though.</li>
<li>Top-seller charts on Apple only reflect the last 24 hours. (IDEA <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">INDIES</span>: get all your friends to buy at once!)</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s the iTunes info about browsing and searching.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you <span class="caps">CAN</span>&#8216;T do</p>

<ul>
<li>You can not sell an album as album-only format without allowing the purchase of single-songs.</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t search by record label, although you can see the record label on the album info page.</li>
<li>There will be no links from iTunes to your website, or to buy the physical CD.</li>
<li>Right now there are no sub-genres, only big genres. (rock/jazz/etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>About the deal to independents</p>

<ul>
<li>They said &#8220;We&#8217;re going to give you the same basic deal we gave the big 5 major labels&#8221;.</li>
<li>Same deal. Same agreements. Same team of people. Same treatment, all-around.</li>
<li>&#8220;We have to be more efficient, though. We&#8217;re not going to deal with 200 lawyers.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Everyone is going to get the exact same deal. It&#8217;s not negotiable. It&#8217;s take it or leave it.&#8221;</li>
<li>This is a reseller agreement: Apple buys at a wholesale price. Apple resells them to users. &#8220;No complicated or messy licenses.&#8221;</li>
<li>Apple only deals with the partner/label. It&#8217;s up to the label to pay the artists, writers, publishing, etc.</li>
<li>Rights are a 3 year term. For iTunes only, of course. This is totally non-exclusive.</li>
<li><span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">PAY</span> <span class="caps">EVERY</span> <span class="caps">MONTH</span>!</li>
<li><span class="caps">IMPORTANT</span>: the details will be mailed to me soon. They haven&#8217;t named specific amounts yet. Instead, they had us sign a contract request form, and they&#8217;ll mail the contract to us. That&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll know more.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="caps">EVERY</span> artist in the store gets&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>listed in new releases</li>
<li>found in searches (any search returns up to 250 songs for that artist)</li>
<li>in the &#8220;browse all artists&#8221; list (the text-based view)</li>
<li>an artist page (page showing all CDs by this artist, top downloaded songs, top downloaded albums, also bought&#8230;)</li>
<li>an album page: artwork, song list, top downloads, references to other artists</li>
<li>listed in cross-references to other albums (&#8220;people who bought this also bought&#8230;&#8221;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Marketing and Promotion</p>

<ul>
<li>10 million customers have opted-in to receive a &#8220;New Music&#8221; email from Apple every Tuesday. Customers of iPod, iTunes, .mac, Apple eNews.</li>
<li>You can have a link directly on your site to point to your music on iTunes. (Of course the link will only work for people who have the iTunes software.)</li>
<li>Google has exclusive discounts for sponsored links into iTunes. Plus some personalized support.</li>
<li>Macs in 57 Apple retail stores are pre-loaded with playlists called, &#8220;Discover Indie Music&#8221;. A chance at in-store play.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to get the music to Apple</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s up to the partner/label to submit all the metadata (artist name, release date, song tiles, etc.), do the audio encoding, and upload the materials.</li>
<li>Every album needs to have a <span class="caps">UPC</span> Barcode!</li>
<li>You have to use their special Music Store Encoder tool for Mac OS X which will be released in 90 days or so.</li>
<li>Independent artists themselves, not with a label, can&#8217;t use this. You have to go through an iTunes partner.</li>
<li>When asked if artists with their own label would be eligible, the iTunes guys had an odd answer, saying that this was invitation-only and they want to deal with those of us in the room.</li>
<li>(CD Baby will be an iTunes partner, and will be glad to do the submission and be your pipeline into iTunes, if we can.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple Does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marketing &amp; merchandising</li>
<li>Advertising, PR, Retail, Direct</li>
<li>30-second Previews</li>
<li>Infrastructure of download &amp; delivery</li>
<li>Credit card transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s all we know for now!</p>

        <h4>Nation-Testing</h4>
        <p>Fox is running a US version of <a href="http://www.testonfox.com/" title="Test the Nation: What Is Your IQ">Test the Nation</a> this Monday.</p>

<p>I dunno, I&#8217;m not sure that the Fox network, in the timeslot previously filled by <a href="http://www.fox.com/mrpersonality/" title="FOX Broadcasting Company: Mr. Personality">Mr. Personality</a>, <a href="http://www.fox.com/mba/" title="FOX Broadcasting Company: Married By America">Married By America</a>, and of course, <a href="http://www.fox.com/joem/" title="Joe Millionaire on FOX">Joe Millionaire</a>, is <em>necessarily</em> where I would turn to to judge America&#8217;s collective intelligence.</p>

        <h4>Bush vs Bush</h4>
        <p>Rather brilliantly, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/" title="COMEDY CENTRAL TV Shows: The Daily Show with Jon Stewart">The Daily Show</a> has been nominated in both the <a href="http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31772" title="Zap2it | TV: NEWS: NEWS DAILY">Outstanding Comedy and Outstanding News</a> categories of the Television Critics Awards.  Totally justified, since they are producing the finest satire in America on an almost-daily basis.  Watch this segment, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/play.php?player=realplayer&amp;type=v&amp;quality=high&amp;reposid=/multimedia/tds/stewart/jon_7131.html" title="COMEDY CENTRAL">Bush vs Bush</a>, if you haven&#8217;t already seen it for one of their finest recent moments.  Complete genius.</p>
