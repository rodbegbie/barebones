        <h4>Bye! Well done! Here&#8217;s a horse for you.  As per usual.</h4>
        <p>I read a report the other day that, in producing iTunes for Windows, <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7298_16-5092603.html?tag=adts" title="ZDNet AnchorDesk: New Apple iTunes: Digital hub or digital flub?">&#8220;Apple has given the world one less reason to buy a Mac&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s completely wrong.</p>

<p>The iPod has been referred to as <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2002/04/03/ipod/" title="BusinessWeek: iPod could be 'Trojan horse' into Wintel">Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Trojan horse&#8217;</a> into the Windows world&#8212;That by making a highly visible, highly desirable piece of technology available to Windows users, they might show how great Apple design is, and create a few <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/" title="Apple - Switch">switchers</a>.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s true.  I was such a switcher.</p>

<p>My first Mac was purchased second-hand for $500 about a month after I got my first iPod, back in January 2002.  I was so impressed with the design, that I wanted to know more about what Apple was up to.  I&#8217;d seen the pretty pictures of OS X, and photos of the <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=g4cube" title="www.apple-history.com / gallery / g4cube">cube</a>, but hadn&#8217;t paid that much attention.  But the iPod was so neat, so beautiful, so ingeniously designed, that I had to know more.  The Mac impressed me so much that 9 months later, I splashed out close to $2,000 on a shiny new Power Mac G4, which I love very much.</p>

<p>And I copied all my MP3s over into iTunes, and all my photos into iPhoto, and bought a digital camcorder so I could use iMovie, and a bluetooth cellphone so I could use iSync, and just generally put the Mac at the centre of my, oh yes, digital hub.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs had me at &#8220;iPo&#8221;.</p>

<p>But there was a fly in the proverbial ointment.  While the iPod was delightful, the user experience on the PC was hellish.  When I first got my iPod, there was no &#8220;Windows iPod&#8221;&#8212;it was meant to be Mac only.  Your choices if you owned a PC were to either use the buggy-as-all-hell crash-your-iPod-and-render-it-useless beta of <a href="http://www.macdrive.com/products/xplay/" title="Mediafour Corporation Products">XPlay</a> or the buggy-as-a-little-bit-of-hell usability-is-for-lusers <a href="http://www.ephpod.com/">EphPod(EphPod &#8211; iPod for Windows (and Linux!))</a>.  While loading MP3s into my iPod for the first time with XPlay, it fucked up my iPod so badly it wouldn&#8217;t boot up.  I spent three days with a $400 doorstop until I could find a friend with a Mac who could wipe and restore it for me before I heard a damned note from the thing.</p>

<p>Then the Windows iPod was released, bundled with MusicMatch.  An improvement, sure.  But still a pretty crappy experience all round.  I&#8217;ve played with MusicMatch briefly, and hated it.  As I <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/16/itunes_for_windo.html" title="groovymother :: iTunes for Windows">mentioned the other day</a>, in the 4 months my wife has had her iPod, we didn&#8217;t manage to successfully sync it to her PC!</p>

<p>By releasing iTunes for Windows, Apple now control the user experience from top to bottom.  You buy music at the iTunes Music Store, organise it in iTunes and download it to your iPod&#8212;Just like on the Mac.  Now all PC users can get to experience the <em>full</em> Apple effect.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#8217;ll see what they&#8217;re missing.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;ll convince them to walk into the Apple Store and see the swishness of the other iApps.</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s a chance a few more people might be loading a lovely new impulse-bought iMac into their car and driving it home.</p>

<p>Which, I think, was the point all along.</p>

                <p>I downloaded iTunes last night for PC because I hate windows media player and I needed something that I could rip music into mp3s with.  Am I a cuntmonkey?  I can&#39;t find the option to make my music into mp3s.  Only the B3656vkjat format that mac uses.  Figured I&#39;d ask if you knew.  :-)</p>
