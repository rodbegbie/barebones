        <p>You may have noticed a new symbol appear at the bottom of the right-column of my page.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/" title="Eric S. Raymond's Home Page">esr&#8217;s</a> proposed new &#8220;Hacker emblem&#8221;</p>

What we haven&#8217;t had, historically, is an emblem that represents the <em>entire</em> hacker community of which all these groups are parts. This is a proposal that we adopt one &mdash; the glider pattern from the Game of Life.</p>

        <h4>&#8220;drank too much gin&#8221;</h4>
        <p>I normally ignore those quizzes that plague Blogistan, but this one, based on Edward Gorey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wishville.co.uk/gorey/start.htm" title="The Gashlycrumb Tinies - by Edward Gorey">The Gashlycrumb Tinies</a> made me smile.  Especially since the one it picked for me was so accurate.</p>

<img src="http://images.quizilla.com/R/redshoecult/1044341450_turesQUIZz.jpg" alt="Go easy on that." /><br />You will drink too much gin. Not the worst way to<br />die, but you won't remember too much of your<br />life. Hey, at least you made some people laugh!

        <h4>Hi Jack</h4>
        <p>Megawickedawesome app of the day: <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/" title="Rogue Amoeba - Audio Hijack">Audio Hijack</a>.  Truly a thing of beauty.  It syphons off the audio from applications like Real Player and stores them on your hard drive.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.highcriteria.com/" title="Sound recording tools: Total Recorder - captures any audio from the Internet, records audio from CD, microphone, line-in, converts any sound formats to WAVE and MP3">hacks to do this on other OSes</a> for ages, but none do it as stylishly as Audio Hijack.  It includes a scheduler to record from &#8220;the radio&#8221; when you command, and can automagically compress it to an <span class="caps">AAC</span> file and add it to your iTunes library.</p>

<p>This morning, I awoke to find a rerun of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml" title="BBC - Radio 4 - Comedy - Just a Minute">Just a Minute</a> ready to sync onto my iPod for the journey to work.  Hurrah!  Well worth the $16 registration.</p>

<p>One supersecret game that&#8217;s been on everyone&#8217;s hot and new list is Extreme Special Olympics, by the folks at EA Sports. This one&#8217;s self-explanatory. You control one of four athletes, each with a distinct personality and skill set. My favorites: Daphne, who believes she can fly (she can&#8217;t, and this comes into play later in the game), and Mickey, who has a mild form of autism and the ability to avoid hugs.</p>

        <h4>For lovers of cute dogs and/or Berkeley Breathed</h4>
        <p>Yesterday, I excitedly IMed Joy to let her know that <a href="http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/opus_returns.html" title="Berkeley Breathed - Opus Returns">Berkeley Breathed&#8217;s new comic strip</a> starts next month.  She then IMed back a link to the <a href="http://www.twbookmark.com/features/flash/flaweddogs.html" title="Berkeley Breathed's Flawed Dog-o-Matic">Flawed Dog-o-Matic</a>, a fun promotional tool for his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316713597/groovymother-20/ref%3Dnosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Flawed Dogs: The Year End Leftovers at the Piddleton Last Chance Dog Pound">Flawed Dogs</a>.</p>

<p>I then picked up a copy of the book on the way home, and blow me if it isn&#8217;t bloody brilliant. A mix of warpedly-cute puppies and odd, funny poetry.  From the <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/gic_LuluLG.html" title="The Official Berkeley Breathed Website">accessorized Lulu</a> to the <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/gic_PepeLG.html" title="The Official Berkeley Breathed Website">Richard Gere look-a-like Pepe</a></p>

<p>So brilliant is it, in fact, that Joy &amp; I decided to spend $150 of wedding gift money on a <a href="https://www.berkeleybreathed.com/store/item-detail.cfm?ID=GIC-01&amp;storeid=1" title="Cool Stuff of Berkeley's to Buy: RosebudEnterprises: Item Detail">signed gicl&eacute;e print of Rollo</a>, combining, as it does, two of my favourite things in the world:  Bassett hounds and Nuns.  It will look totally handsome on our walls, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

        <h4>Trailer Park</h4>
        <p>I managed to make it through <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/18/saturday_night_a.html" title="groovymother :: Saturday Night at the Movies. and Friday Night. and Saturday Afternoon. and...">all five movies</a> at the weekend.  You can read reviews of them <a href="http://www.checkthegrid.com/" title="CheckTheGrid.com">elsewhere</a>, so all I&#8217;ll say is that they&#8217;re all worth seeing.  Oh, and &#8220;Go <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1288436/" title="Zabeth Russell">Zabs</a>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I <strong>did</strong> see a lot of trailers.  Some more than once.  One of them, five sodding times.  So here are my reviews of <em>all of them</em>, beginning with the genre I have nothing but loathing for&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Historical Epics</strong></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Actors seem to think that they can just clinch an Oscar by making a historical epic.  They don&#8217;t seem to realise that we&#8217;re all just fucking sick of historical epics.&#8221;</em>&#8212;Joy, after seeing Tom Cruise&#8217;s face in the trailer for The Last Samurai.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/master_and_commander/" title="Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</a>&#8212;I cannot say enough bad things about this trailer.  It preceded every movie this weekend, and by the end, I was doing Rocky Horror-style call &amp; response with Mr Crowe.  It&#8217;s Historical!  Epic!  Worthy!  And really dull looking.  Like Titanic, but without Kate Winslett&#8217;s breasts.  Besides, I could never watch a movie featuring such appalling hair as is sported in this trailer.  (And what is up with the massive <span class="caps">URL</span>? (<a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/"><a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/">http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/</a></a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/the_alamo/" title="The Alamo">The Alamo</a>&#8212;The same movie as Master and Commander, but with less water.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/the_last_samurai/" title="The Last Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>&#8212;I grew bored of this trailer before it had started.  I can remember nothing about it.  Not a good sign.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look like they should be worth $10</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/love_actually/" title="Love Actually">Love Actually</a>&#8212;I liked <span class="caps">FWAAF</span> and Notting Hill, and this looks pretty danged good too.  I also admire the restraint of the trailer&#8217;s editor, who only gives a brief glimpse of Rowan Atkinson, when you just <em>know</em> that he&#8217;s going to deliver some scene-stealing performances.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/elf/" title="Elf">Elf</a>&#8212;Will Ferrell rocks.  Jon Favreau rocks.  This movie looks great.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/BadSanta-10001275/preview.php">Bad Santa(Bad Santa (2003): Billy Bob Thornton, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham, Terry Zwigoff)</a>&#8212;I&#8217;ve heard almost nothing about this film, but it looks like it could be a winner.  A nice R-rated comedy from the director of Ghost World, starring Billy-Bob Thornton as a thieving drunken Santa.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Could go either way</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/along_came_polly/" title="Apple - Trailers - Along Came Polly">Along Came Polly</a>&#8212;On the upside, the blind ferret.  On the downside, Jennifer Aniston.  Ah, the blind ferret/Jennifer Aniston trade-off happens once again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/scary_movie_3/trailer.html" title="Apple - Trailers - Scary Movie 3">Scary Movie 3</a>&#8212;Yes, the first two movies were shit, but this one&#8217;s directed by David Zucker.  The trailer has some classic bits of <span class="caps">ZAZ</span> slapstick, but seems to rely heavily of current cultural references (Simon Cowell, &#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221;) which will age badly (just look at the &#8220;Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home&#8221; line in Airplane.  Apparently that&#8217;s a reference to a coffee commercial of the day)</li>
<li><a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_cmp/trailers_rev_frames.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix Revolutions</a>&#8212;I really must get around to watching the second one first.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that I will drag Joy to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/looneytunesbackinaction/" title="Looney Tunes Back In Action">Looney Tunes Back In Action</a>&#8212;So sue me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/paycheck/" title="Apple - Trailers - Paycheck">Paycheck</a>&#8212;Because Ben Affleck action flicks are pretty decent if you hand your brain in at the door.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that Joy will drag me to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/timeline/" title="index">Timeline</a>&#8212;Apparently Joy enjoyed the book, but she &#8220;had real problems with the underlying physics&#8221;.  Ah, I&#8217;ve married a smartie.  Also amusing that Richard Donner is billed as &#8220;The Director of Lethal Weapon&#8221;, as if he&#8217;s done nothing else in the 16 years between.

        <h4>Bye! Well done! Here&#8217;s a horse for you.  As per usual.</h4>
        <p>I read a report the other day that, in producing iTunes for Windows, <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7298_16-5092603.html?tag=adts" title="ZDNet AnchorDesk: New Apple iTunes: Digital hub or digital flub?">&#8220;Apple has given the world one less reason to buy a Mac&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s completely wrong.</p>

<p>The iPod has been referred to as <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2002/04/03/ipod/" title="BusinessWeek: iPod could be 'Trojan horse' into Wintel">Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Trojan horse&#8217;</a> into the Windows world&#8212;That by making a highly visible, highly desirable piece of technology available to Windows users, they might show how great Apple design is, and create a few <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/" title="Apple - Switch">switchers</a>.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s true.  I was such a switcher.</p>

<p>My first Mac was purchased second-hand for $500 about a month after I got my first iPod, back in January 2002.  I was so impressed with the design, that I wanted to know more about what Apple was up to.  I&#8217;d seen the pretty pictures of OS X, and photos of the <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=g4cube" title="www.apple-history.com / gallery / g4cube">cube</a>, but hadn&#8217;t paid that much attention.  But the iPod was so neat, so beautiful, so ingeniously designed, that I had to know more.  The Mac impressed me so much that 9 months later, I splashed out close to $2,000 on a shiny new Power Mac G4, which I love very much.</p>

<p>And I copied all my MP3s over into iTunes, and all my photos into iPhoto, and bought a digital camcorder so I could use iMovie, and a bluetooth cellphone so I could use iSync, and just generally put the Mac at the centre of my, oh yes, digital hub.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs had me at &#8220;iPo&#8221;.</p>

<p>But there was a fly in the proverbial ointment.  While the iPod was delightful, the user experience on the PC was hellish.  When I first got my iPod, there was no &#8220;Windows iPod&#8221;&#8212;it was meant to be Mac only.  Your choices if you owned a PC were to either use the buggy-as-all-hell crash-your-iPod-and-render-it-useless beta of <a href="http://www.macdrive.com/products/xplay/" title="Mediafour Corporation Products">XPlay</a> or the buggy-as-a-little-bit-of-hell usability-is-for-lusers <a href="http://www.ephpod.com/">EphPod(EphPod &#8211; iPod for Windows (and Linux!))</a>.  While loading MP3s into my iPod for the first time with XPlay, it fucked up my iPod so badly it wouldn&#8217;t boot up.  I spent three days with a $400 doorstop until I could find a friend with a Mac who could wipe and restore it for me before I heard a damned note from the thing.</p>

<p>Then the Windows iPod was released, bundled with MusicMatch.  An improvement, sure.  But still a pretty crappy experience all round.  I&#8217;ve played with MusicMatch briefly, and hated it.  As I <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/16/itunes_for_windo.html" title="groovymother :: iTunes for Windows">mentioned the other day</a>, in the 4 months my wife has had her iPod, we didn&#8217;t manage to successfully sync it to her PC!</p>

<p>By releasing iTunes for Windows, Apple now control the user experience from top to bottom.  You buy music at the iTunes Music Store, organise it in iTunes and download it to your iPod&#8212;Just like on the Mac.  Now all PC users can get to experience the <em>full</em> Apple effect.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#8217;ll see what they&#8217;re missing.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;ll convince them to walk into the Apple Store and see the swishness of the other iApps.</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s a chance a few more people might be loading a lovely new impulse-bought iMac into their car and driving it home.</p>

<p>Which, I think, was the point all along.</p>

        <h4>Saturday Night at the Movies.  and Friday Night.  and Saturday Afternoon.  and&#8230;</h4>
        <p>After being <a href="http://www.rodandjoyswedding.com/" title="rOD Begbie &amp; Joy Carletti's Wedding Log">really quite busy</a> for the last few weeks, and since our evening schedule for next week has <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2003/series?series=bosnyy" title="ESPN.com - MLB Playoffs 2003: Boston vs. New York">helpfully been cleared</a>, Joy &amp; I decided it was time to catch up on a load of movie releases that passed us by recently.  So this weekend is going to be spent practically living in the local multiplex.</p>

<p>Last night was <a href="http://www.schoolofrockmovie.com/" title="School of Rock">School of Rock</a> and <a href="http://www.runawayjurymovie.com/" title="RUNAWAY JURY">Runaway Jury</a>, to be followed by <a href="http://www.kill-bill.com/" title="Kill Bill - OCTOBER 10th VOLUME 1 -">Kill Bill</a>, <a href="http://mysticrivermovie.warnerbros.com/index.php" title="Mystic River">Mystic River</a> and <a href="http://www.intolerablecruelty.com/index.php" title="Universal Pictures: Intolerable Cruelty">Intolerable Cruelty</a> today.</p>

<p>And over the next week, we hope to hit <a href="http://www.lost-in-translation.com/" title="Lost in Translation">Lost in Translation</a> and <a href="http://pirates.movies.go.com/" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl -- The Official Website">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, the latter of which is currently playing at the <a href="http://www.somervilletheatreonline.com/" title="Capitol Theatre | Somerville Theatre">second-run cinema</a> down the street.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be sick of Junior Mints by this time next week, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

        <h4>iTunes for Windows</h4>
        <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple - iTunes">iTunes for Windows</a>.  Hurrah!</p>

<p>First impressions:  Works <em>almost</em> identically to the Mac version (some slight bugs with Smart Playlists), which is a very good thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very excited to finally be able to share my music between PCs.  Will be very handy at home for me &amp; Joy to ransack each other&#8217;s collections, and could be fun at work.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to nuking MusicMatch off of Joy&#8217;s PC later.  It really is a god-awful piece of crap, compared to the shiny reliable iTunes.  I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve managed to sync up her iPod <em>once</em> since the initial load.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of sad, though, that while the CxO of <span class="caps">AOL</span> was on Apple&#8217;s stage boasting about <span class="caps">AOL</span> linking into the iTunes Music Store, the Nullsoft division of <span class="caps">AOL</span> chose today to release the first beta of <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=152845" title="WINAMP.COM | Forums - Winamp 5 Beta 1 Released">Winamp 5</a>.  As if anyone&#8217;s going to notice.</p>

        <h4>nOMENCLATURE</h4>
        <p>Since Joy has changed her name, I thought it was time I put an end to an old and ultimately pointless joke of my own.  I&#8217;m getting back into the habit of typing my name with correct capitalisation.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rOD&#8221; thing started at my old consulting gig.  My employers went through an extensive (and frankly, <strong>much</strong> needed) rebranding exercise.  Huge screeds of documentation were produced on how to apply the new brand.  In a suitably satyrical stylee, I announced to my team that I was rebranding myself, and they should follow my new guidelines on how to write my name.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I took advantage of various opportunities to &#8220;adjust&#8221; internal systems within the company to comply.  An unattended server in the server room allowed me to change my outgoing email.  The well-known System password for the HR database (&#8220;garfield&#8221;, in case they still haven&#8217;t changed it) allowed me to show up correctly on the intranet.  Quite frankly, the only reason I didn&#8217;t change the payroll system when I had the chance was the fear of screwing up my paychecks.</p>

<p>But I was laid-off from that job over two years ago (perhaps unsurprisingly, given my confessions in the previous paragraph), and I kept the joke alive out of laziness.  So time&#8217;s up&#8212;rOD is dead, long live Rod.</p>

        <h4>Clobbering Commentspam</h4>
        <p>Amongst the 199 messages in my Inbox upon getting home (not counting all the mailing list stuff filtered away, and the 427 spams caught by <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/" title="SpamAssassin: Welcome to SpamAssassin">SpamAssassin</a>) were a bunch of emails from MovableType telling me comments had been posted to my blog.  Frustratingly, most of these were spammers trying to abuse blogs to garner precious PageRank.</p>

<p>I spent a wee while this morning pondering on ways to block the spammybastards.  Then I loaded Bloglines and found someone had already done all the hard work for me.  <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/mtblacklist_stop_spam_now" title="MT-Blacklist: Stop Spam Now :: The Daily Journey :: JayAllen.org">MT-Blacklist</a>&#8212;Essential if you&#8217;re running MT and being clobbered by commentspam too.</p>

        <h4>Well, honey, I suppose, because it&#8217;s sweet as honey&#8230;</h4>
        <p>Back from Disney World.  Photos were <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/07/just_married.html" title="groovymother :: Just Married">once again</a> limited, due to knocking the phone off the balcony approximately 10 minutes after that first photo was taken, so I was too scared to carry it around the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Rumours that, whilst honeymooning, we caught <em>every</em> Red Sox/Yankees game on TV are unfounded&#8230;  Fox didn&#8217;t show Game 1 in Florida, because it clashed with a Marlins/Cubs game.</p>

        <h4>Just Married</h4>
        <p>Wow, the third finger of my left hand feels heavier than usual today.</p>

<p>Yesterday was unbelievably brillo.  Joy looked gorgeous, our ceremony went without a hitch (included a rocking improvised song called &#8220;Don&#8217;t Go To Bed Angry&#8221; and a demonstration of how improvisation and married life are related), and then within 20 minutes of getting to the reception, the Red Sox took the lead, then won, Game 4.</p>

<p>Oh, and I left the <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/02/i_am_the_moblog.html#000821" title="groovymother :: I Am the Moblog">cellphone</a> at home, because I am an arse.  I&#8217;ll try and get some good shots at Disney to make up.</p>

        <p>Another nifty thing about this <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/02/maziacs_have_to_.html" title="groovymother :: Maziacs have to eat too">new phone</a> is the combination of built-in camera and email, which means I can &#8220;moblog&#8221; (gawd, I hate that term.  Sounds too much like &#8220;mob law&#8221; to me).</p>

        <p>My one-year contract with AT&amp;T Wireless is up, so it&#8217;s time for my annual shop-around-for-a-funky-new-cellphone  (Last year&#8217;s experiments:  <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2002/09/27/new_toy_new_toy_.html" title="groovymother :: New Toy New Toy New Toy!">1</a>, <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2002/10/09/new_toy_new_toy_.html">2(groovymother :: New Toy New Toy New Toy!
