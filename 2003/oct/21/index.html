        <h4>Trailer Park</h4>
        <p>I managed to make it through <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/10/18/saturday_night_a.html" title="groovymother :: Saturday Night at the Movies. and Friday Night. and Saturday Afternoon. and...">all five movies</a> at the weekend.  You can read reviews of them <a href="http://www.checkthegrid.com/" title="CheckTheGrid.com">elsewhere</a>, so all I&#8217;ll say is that they&#8217;re all worth seeing.  Oh, and &#8220;Go <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1288436/" title="Zabeth Russell">Zabs</a>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I <strong>did</strong> see a lot of trailers.  Some more than once.  One of them, five sodding times.  So here are my reviews of <em>all of them</em>, beginning with the genre I have nothing but loathing for&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Historical Epics</strong></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Actors seem to think that they can just clinch an Oscar by making a historical epic.  They don&#8217;t seem to realise that we&#8217;re all just fucking sick of historical epics.&#8221;</em>&#8212;Joy, after seeing Tom Cruise&#8217;s face in the trailer for The Last Samurai.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/master_and_commander/" title="Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</a>&#8212;I cannot say enough bad things about this trailer.  It preceded every movie this weekend, and by the end, I was doing Rocky Horror-style call &amp; response with Mr Crowe.  It&#8217;s Historical!  Epic!  Worthy!  And really dull looking.  Like Titanic, but without Kate Winslett&#8217;s breasts.  Besides, I could never watch a movie featuring such appalling hair as is sported in this trailer.  (And what is up with the massive <span class="caps">URL</span>? (<a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/"><a href="http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/">http://www.masterandcommanderthefarsideoftheworld.com/</a></a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/the_alamo/" title="The Alamo">The Alamo</a>&#8212;The same movie as Master and Commander, but with less water.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/the_last_samurai/" title="The Last Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>&#8212;I grew bored of this trailer before it had started.  I can remember nothing about it.  Not a good sign.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look like they should be worth $10</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/love_actually/" title="Love Actually">Love Actually</a>&#8212;I liked <span class="caps">FWAAF</span> and Notting Hill, and this looks pretty danged good too.  I also admire the restraint of the trailer&#8217;s editor, who only gives a brief glimpse of Rowan Atkinson, when you just <em>know</em> that he&#8217;s going to deliver some scene-stealing performances.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/elf/" title="Elf">Elf</a>&#8212;Will Ferrell rocks.  Jon Favreau rocks.  This movie looks great.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/BadSanta-10001275/preview.php">Bad Santa(Bad Santa (2003): Billy Bob Thornton, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham, Terry Zwigoff)</a>&#8212;I&#8217;ve heard almost nothing about this film, but it looks like it could be a winner.  A nice R-rated comedy from the director of Ghost World, starring Billy-Bob Thornton as a thieving drunken Santa.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Could go either way</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/along_came_polly/" title="Apple - Trailers - Along Came Polly">Along Came Polly</a>&#8212;On the upside, the blind ferret.  On the downside, Jennifer Aniston.  Ah, the blind ferret/Jennifer Aniston trade-off happens once again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/scary_movie_3/trailer.html" title="Apple - Trailers - Scary Movie 3">Scary Movie 3</a>&#8212;Yes, the first two movies were shit, but this one&#8217;s directed by David Zucker.  The trailer has some classic bits of <span class="caps">ZAZ</span> slapstick, but seems to rely heavily of current cultural references (Simon Cowell, &#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221;) which will age badly (just look at the &#8220;Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home&#8221; line in Airplane.  Apparently that&#8217;s a reference to a coffee commercial of the day)</li>
<li><a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_cmp/trailers_rev_frames.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix Revolutions</a>&#8212;I really must get around to watching the second one first.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that I will drag Joy to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/looneytunesbackinaction/" title="Looney Tunes Back In Action">Looney Tunes Back In Action</a>&#8212;So sue me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/paycheck/" title="Apple - Trailers - Paycheck">Paycheck</a>&#8212;Because Ben Affleck action flicks are pretty decent if you hand your brain in at the door.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Films that look dreadful, but that Joy will drag me to regardless</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/timeline/" title="index">Timeline</a>&#8212;Apparently Joy enjoyed the book, but she &#8220;had real problems with the underlying physics&#8221;.  Ah, I&#8217;ve married a smartie.  Also amusing that Richard Donner is billed as &#8220;The Director of Lethal Weapon&#8221;, as if he&#8217;s done nothing else in the 16 years between.  Well, I suppose &#8220;From the director of Scrooged&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t have gone over so well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/houseofsandandfog.html" title="Apple - Trailers - House of Sand and Fog">House of Sand and Fog</a>&#8212;Sadly not titled &#8220;House of Fog and Sand&#8221;, cause then I could make some witty pun about &#8220;Bag of Fuckin&#8217; Shite, more like&#8221;.  But it isn&#8217;t, so I can&#8217;t.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/cheaperbythedozen/" title="Cheaper By The Dozen">Cheaper By The Dozen</a>&#8212;Because Joy has a Bonnie Hunt thing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>No!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/columbia/the_missing/" title="The Missing">The Missing</a>&#8212;Blah.  Discussion in cinema after seeing the words &#8220;Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones&#8221; on screen:  Me: &#8220;What did Tommy Lee Jones win an Oscar for?&#8221;  Joy:  &#8220;Dunno.  The Fugitive?&#8221;  Me: &#8220;Men in Black II?&#8221;  Joy: &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it have been cool if they&#8217;d promoted <span class="caps">MIB</span> II as starring Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones and Oscar Nominee Will Smith?&#8221;  That conversation was more interesting than this trailer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/returnoftheking/" title="The Return Of The King">The Lord of the Rings <span class="caps">III</span></a>&#8212;I didn&#8217;t go see the first two, and have no desire to see this one either.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/filmseries/" title="SUNDANCE CHANNEL">Sundance Film Series</a>&#8212;Trailers for Die Mommie Die and Dopamime.  Just because they&#8217;re indie doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t suck big donkeys cocks in hell forever.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The best danged thing to precede the actual movie</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The new &#8220;switch off your cellphones&#8221; announcement featuring <a href="http://www.bbdoatl.com/work_cing.html" title="[ BBDO ATLANTA ]">Inconsiderate Cellphone Man</a>.  &#8221;<em>Mauled</em> by a <em>tiger</em>?&#8221;.  Made me laugh every time I saw it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The worst, most patronising insult-to-the-intelligence piece-of-crap to precede the movie</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.respectcopyrights.org/hear-artists.html" title="Respect Copyrights">The Set Painter</a> bitching about pirates taking money out of his pocket.  Oh, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3210486.stm" title="BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Film | Hollywood 'need not fear piracy'">fuck off</a>.</li>
