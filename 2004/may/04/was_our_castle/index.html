        <h4>Was our castle and our keep</h4>
        <p>I posted <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2004/05/04/our_new_home.html" title="&#8220;groovy mother&#8221; :: Our new home">a photo</a> earlier, but I figured I&#8217;d elucidate.  Joy &amp; I are now homeowners.  Or, at least, mortgageholders.</p>

<p>We closed on Friday, then spent close to two hours on Saturday night at Home Depot&#8212;Joy getting paint, and me wandering round looking at random tools and deciding that I just <strong>had</strong> to own one.  We&#8217;re painting this weekend, and hope to move in the weekend after.</p>

<p>The piece of advice that we wish we&#8217;d had time to listen to is &#8220;if you don&#8217;t trust your real estate broker, then find one you do trust&#8221;.  Due to <a href="http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2004/03/15/one_week_later.html" title="&#8220;groovy mother&#8221; :: One Week Later">pressures of time</a>, we were stuck with the guy who we happened to run into at an open house.</p>

<p>I suppose it was a bad sign that he immediately reminded me of <a href="http://www.magitek.nu/gil/" title="Patheticism">Gil from The Simpsons</a>.  From the first meeting (when we&#8217;d told him that we were looking for properties in the $300&#8211;350k range, and he presented us with the option of buying a $800k property and splitting it with friends), to the day of the closing (when he proceeded to lose his temper on the phone&#8212;on three separate calls&#8212;to Joy, the seller and the lawyer representing the mortgage company), he was a king klutz who gave the impression that he&#8217;d never sold a house before, despite having 10 years of realtor experience.</p>

<p>He was unable to answer basic questions that we, as first-time housebuyers, had.  He seemed bamboozled by the process of filling out forms like the Offer and Purchase &amp; Sales Agreement.  During the home inspection, he appeared more concerned with downplaying defects to save his commission than actually making sure the house was something we wanted to buy.  Talking to him made me wish that telephones came with some way to bitchslap the person at the other end of the line.</p>

<p>Having to deal with <a href="http://www.prudentialbuccelli.com/agent_detail.cfm?aID=1192" title="Prudential Prime Properties Buccelli Real Estate">Tom Bransten</a> was the most stressful part of buying the house.  Thankfully, we never have to speak to the man again.  You are encouraged to avoid him too.</p>

                <p>Congrats on finally settling on a house. It looks great. Can we have some specs and more photos ? I&#39;m dying to know what you get for your price range.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still looking around the Northern Virginia area, but the prices are scaring us silly. We&#39;re in the same price bracket as yourselves. Maybe we should move back to Cambridge!</p>
