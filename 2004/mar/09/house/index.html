        <h4>House!</h4>
        <p>What started last week as idle &#8220;we should buy a house&#8221; chatter, evolved over the weekend into hardcore phoning-round-realtors and calling banks to find out about mortages.</p>

<p>Because, you know, since we got the wedding over and done with, we haven&#8217;t had a back-breakingly complicated high-stress life-changing project, and, frankly, we were missing it; all this free time was just killing us.</p>

<p>Task for tonight:  Spend some time reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764553313/groovymother-20/ref%3Dnosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Home Buying for Dummies">House Buying for Dummies</a> and <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/cat_house.html" title="Jeremy Zawodny's blog: House Archives">Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blogged house-buying experiences</a>.</p>

                <p>My suggestion is that the best thing you can do is get a good realtor. Talk to people you know who have gone through the process and get their recommendations for realtors, and then interview a few. A good realtor will walk you through everything. Most likely they will have a couple of recommendations for mortgage brokers as well. Mortgage rates are at record lows again, so now&#39;s a really good time to be in the market for a mortgage.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been through the process a couple of times, first with a townhouse and then with our current house, and as long as you don&#39;t mind reading A LOT of documentation and signing your name A LOT of times, it isn&#39;t too bad. The actual move is the worst part.</p>

                <p>At least you managed to get through 4 months before starting &#39;the conversation&#39;. We&#39;re married less than a month and the house hunting has started !! :) or :( or :0</p>

<p>Good luck with it, the prices here in the Reston area are frightening, maybe we should move back to Mass ! At least we&#39;d be closer to the sea.</p>

                <p>Buying a house isn&#39;t all that bad.  We had a horrible realtor but a fantastic mortgage broker.  As long as you have a good one or the other, you&#39;ll be fine.  I did so much research and it did us no good.  The best thing I found was advice from friends/parents.</p>

                <p>Spending the extra cash to get a realtor of your own is the best as otherwise they&#39;re less legally obliged to tell you certain things: they&#39;ll also be more honest as you&#39;re the one paying them.<br />Getting a mortgage broker is the way to go. They do a ton of ringing around to get the lowest rates and the best thing of all is that they usually take their closing costs (can be 2000-3000 grand) out of the comission they recieve from the bank. This is a piece of information I could have used when buying but only found out after. Let me know and I can send you on a few names I&#39;ve been referred.</p>
