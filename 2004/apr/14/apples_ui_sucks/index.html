        <h4>Apple&#8217;s UI Sucks</h4>
        <p>One of the advertised features of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/isync/" title="Apple - iSync">iSync</a> package is that you can use it with their ($99-a-year) .mac service to access your Address Book on the web when you need it.</p>

<p>The other day, I was in a meeting and needed to get a phone number.  I didn&#8217;t have my Palm Pilot in the room, but have no fear, I knew I could access it quickly via the .mac service.  Here&#8217;s just how quick and easy it was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.mac.com/"><a href="http://www.mac.com/">http://www.mac.com/</a></a></li>
<li>Click on the nice big &#8220;Address Book&#8221; graphic at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Get taken to a promotional page advertising the wonders of the .mac address book.</li>
<li>Hunt around page for link to Login.  (Ignoring the &#8220;Logout&#8221; link on the toolbar which displays whether you&#8217;re logged in or not!)</li>
<li>Eventually find small &#8220;Already a member?&#8221; link in middle of promotional text imploring me to join.</li>
<li>Click it.</li>
<li>Get asked for username &amp; password.</li>
<li>Enter username &amp; password.</li>
<li>Get taken back to the .mac homepage.  Not the Address Book as I might have hoped.</li>
<li>Hunt around for (smaller) Address Book graphic, now in a completely different part of the screen from before.</li>
<li>Click it.</li>
<li>Get asked <em>again</em> for password.</li>
<li>Enter password <em>again</em>.</li>
<li>Finally get to a screen where I can access my phone book.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that Apple&#8217;s famed UI team don&#8217;t speak to the website folks much.</p>

                <p>1. Go to <a href="http://www.mac.com" rel="nofollow">www.mac.com</a><br />2. See that the page lists my iDisk user name from my last use and click &quot;log in&quot;<br />3. My .Mac user name (<a href="mailto:lesposen@mac.com">lesposen@mac.com</a>) automatically appears and I enter my password.<br />4. Back to .mac page, says I am logged in, and I click Address book.<br />5. It asks me to once more enter my password as a verification process (to overcome autolog in security issues?).<br />6. After entering password once more, it takes me to Address book details, which is currently set to display 10 items at a time<br />7. Come back to <a href="http://arsecandle.com" rel="nofollow">arsecandle.com</a> to post this comment which takes an extraordinary time to contact the server.</p>

                <p>I kind of agree with you.  I didn&#39;t find it took 15 steps, but it did take me to the promotional screen when I first clicked address book.  That was annonying.<br />What I find frustrating is that it must load all the graphics on the login page before I can check email.  For some reason that takes several seconds even on a fast connection.  I wish they&#39;d get rid of the graphics.  I also wish they would add shortcuts for the various .mac featuers.  <a href="http://mail.mac.com" rel="nofollow">mail.mac.com</a>, <a href="http://address.mac.com" rel="nofollow">address.mac.com</a> ect...</p>

                <p>Les --</p>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that, even if you&#39;ve previously logged into .mac on your machine, and know *exactly* what you&#39;re doing, it still takes 5 page views and two password prompts to get to the information you&#39;re after.</p>

<p>Where I come from, that&#39;d be considered pretty shitty.  I&#39;d have been faster going to <a href="http://Amazon.com" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a> and looking up my address book there!</p>

No double passwords to type (one at .mac the other at mail) and plain simple. When you logout you&#39;ll be at the .mac front page. Simple, huh?</p>

                <p>Melangell - Why is he an idiot? I love my Mac (running OS X 10.3) - but even I have to agree with the author that logging into .Mac can/is a hassle.<br />Granted, I&#39;ve learned NOT to click on &quot;Mail&quot; or &quot;Address Book&quot; first, without logging in (or you get the promo page) - but I always found it redundant to have to log in TWICE.. (once, if you&#39;re NOT already logged in, and a second time if after you click Mail/Address Book/etc.)<br />Personally, YOU seem like the idiot for your rude post.... :)</p>

                <p>In defense of melangell</p>

<p>of course one is going to receive comments like idiot when one posts such an inflammatory title as Apple&#39;s UI sucks.  If one expects civil discourse, perhaps one should begin conversation in a civil manner.</p>

<p>With that said - logging in is a simple matter and not very uncommon for any website.  Look, listen, and learn.  Perhaps then you will find that you need not post titles/comments like, oh I don&#39;t know, Apple’s UI Sucks.</p>

                <p>I think the title was a great one - maybe .Mac UI Sucks would have been clearer but it got me to read the post and I would never have come here otherwise. I think the comment is well made though - I found the .Mac interface quite convoluted and non intuitive. Yes it was very easy to sign up for the product but after that it took a while and a few &quot;ahhh is that how they want you do it moments&quot; to get where I wanted to - which to me indicates that yes, the OS UI dudes need to chat with the .Mac UI dudes.</p>
