        <h4>Dead Tree Cavalcade</h4>
        <p>Bah!  Curse you, <a href="http://96db.com/blog/Books/BookMeme.htm" title="Thiamin Trek Weblog Archives: Books/BookMeme">Keith</a>.</p>

<p>I was going to state here that normally I avoid memes (what do you think this is?  Bloody LiveJournal?), but I relented since a) as you follow all the links back, you discover that lots of people state &#8220;I normally don&#8217;t do this, but&#8230;&#8221;, so I&#8217;d be blindingly unoriginal, and b) I like books.</p>

<p><strong>Total number of books I&#8217;ve owned:</strong> No idea.  Over my lifetime, probably about 500 or so.</p>

<p><strong>Last book I bought:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/006073132X/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything">Freakonomics</a>, which I picked up on the strength of its <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/book/0,6115,1046301_5_0_,00.html" title="Entertainment Weekly's EW.com | Book Review: Freakonomics">brief review</a> in Entertainment Weekly.</p>

<p><strong>Last book I read:</strong> Currently next to the lavvy is Evan Dorkin&#8217;s compilation of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0943151988/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Bill &amp; Ted's Most Excellent Adventures, Vol. 1">Bill &amp; Ted&#8217;s Most Excellent Adventures comics</a>.  I picked up a few of these comics back when they first came out (circa 1991), and really enjoyed them.  Sadly, I&#8217;m not enjoying the reprint as much.  Who would have thought that my tastes would have changed in the intervening fourteen years?  Totally non-non-heinous.</p>

<p><strong>Last book I finished:</strong> I read in quick succession a fairly well-linked threesome of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1591841003/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: All Marketers Are Liars : The Power of Telling Authentic Stories in a Low-Trust World">All Marketers Are Liars</a>, which makes reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0316172324/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking">Blink</a>, whose author is quoted on the cover of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/006073132X/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything">Freakonomics</a>.  All three give plenty of food for thought on the fact that there&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;rational&#8221; human behaviour, and are recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Five books that mean a lot to me:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0141301155/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Puffin Novels)(Amazon.com: Books: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Puffin Novels))</a>.  You can stick yer Harry Potter up yer collective metaphorical arse.  Roald Dahl is the finest childrens author of all time, and while Matilda, The Witches and The <span class="caps">BFG</span> are all superb, Charlie wins because it was the first one I read (or rather, had read to me).  I still have my original copy, bought for me when I was 5 years old.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0393314804/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: Trainspotting">Trainspotting</a>.  This was the book that reminded me how much fun reading could be, after five years of enforced dreadful dreary books at high school had sapped my will to read.  I picked it up largely because it had a character called Begbie in it, and was engrossed.  It&#8217;s not an easy read (even if you do know the Edinburgh accent), but it is worth it&#8212;The &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; chapter in particular sticks in my mind.  I read it over the summer of 1995, on the bus between Heriot Watt University and the branch of Comet where I worked, and haven&#8217;t re-read it since for fear that it won&#8217;t live up to my memory.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1400032350/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Bug">The Bug</a>.  A fine, fine novel, and an incredibly deep investigation of the psyche of the software engineer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1590593898/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon.com: Joel on Software: And on Diverse and Occasionally Related Matters That Will Prove of Interest to Software Developers, Designers, and Managers, and to Those Who, Whether by Good Fortune or Ill Luck, Work with Them in Some Capacity">Joel on Software</a>.  Brilliant, humourous and perfectly opinionated writing on a myriad of different topics, important to anyone who shuffles bits around buses for a living.  It helps you understand what&#8217;s going on inside both your computer and your co-workers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1573228214/groovymother-20/ref=nosim/">High Fidelity(Amazon.com: Books: High Fidelity (Movie-tie In) : A Novel)</a> that I borrowed from Joy the night I met her, and have never returned.  Or read, for that matter.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Saw the &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; banner at the top of your Blog. According to someone in this morning&#39;s &quot;Scotsman&quot;, Geldorf and Co. are fundamentally misguided. Apparently Africa is the richest continent on the planet in terms of natural resources per inhabitant. The problem is not lack of wealth, it is African Governments and sending aid merely makes the governments more corrupt. From your position of power in the USofA, can&#39;t you get George W Bush on the case. Sorry we can&#39;t offer any support from Tony this time as he is going to be far too busy sorting out the French and the Dutch. Allegedly he is going soft on the issue of ID cards as they might help prevent &quot;identity theft&quot; and this would mean that New Labour would have to give the Tories their identity back!<br /></p>
