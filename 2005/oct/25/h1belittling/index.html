        <h4>H-1Belittling</h4>
        <p>Ooh, I&#8217;m grumpy at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/25/44OPreality_1.html" title="The H-1B swindle | InfoWorld | Column | 2005-10-25 | By Ephraim Schwartz">this InfoWorld article</a> which makes your standard &#8220;Bloody foreigners!  Coming across here and stealing our jobs, sleeping with our food, and eating our wives and children&#8221; argument about computer programmers.  For those unware, H1B is a specific visa that allows a non-US citizen to work in the US for a specific employer, for no more than six years.  And it&#8217;s how I entered the country in 1998.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he fails to link to the original report, instead cherry picking facts like &#8220;On average, applications for H-1B workers in computer occupations were for wages $13,000 less than Americans in the same occupation and state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note that he just refers to &#8220;workers in computer occupations&#8221;.  Not &#8220;workers in computer occupations with three years experience&#8221;.  Apparently, every programmer is created equal.  I&#8217;d hazard that most H1-B holders are like I was&#8212;Just out of university, and wanting to move to the States.  If that&#8217;s the case, then it makes sense that the &#8220;average&#8221; H1-B holder gets paid less than the &#8220;average&#8221; permanent resident.  They&#8217;re probably less experienced.</p>

<p>Also, the sources quoted seem very apples and oranges.  The H1B salaries were taken from the information filed <em>at the time the H1B holder was hired</em>.  In my first job, my salary went up by 50% over the two years I was employed there, but that was never reported to the immigration services.  On the other hand, the Bureau of Labour statistics are refreshed every few months by asking employers for salary information.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to see the original report to know for sure, but for now it looks like nothing more than fodder for <a href="http://www.minutemanhq.com/" title="MinutemanHQ">anti-immigration fuckwits</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>: Although the report isn&#8217;t on their site, I&#8217;ve just found the authors, <a href="http://programmersguild.org/" title="The Programmers Guild">The Programmers Guild</a>.  Wow, they&#8217;re a lot closer to the Minuteman Militia than I&#8217;d imagined.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span><sup>2</sup></strong>:  Ephraim Schwartz, author of the article, has responded in <a href="http://groovymother.com/archives/2005/10/25/h1belittling.html#comments">my comments</a>.  Thanks, Ephraim.</p>

                <p>Well, I guess you keep your audience with your sparkling humor, such as fuckwits. Hard for me to respect  your arguments when you stoop to mindless name calling.<br />Nevertheless, I&#39;m all for hiring new immigrants in the U.S. Immigration is what has made America such a powerful, innovative country. Not that we don&#39;t have faults but we do have a few pluses also.</p>

<p>My columns on H-1B visas tries to discuss what is fair not mindless hate mongering of anyone who was not born in the U.S.<br /> I think it is unfair to hire people at a lower than prevailing wage because you can get away with it. You can get away with it because these folks are in a strange country and want to stay to learn or to immigrate I suppose. </p>

<p>Finally, the report will be made public in a few weeks I am told. I was sent an advance copy under the promise of confidentiality. </p>

<p>Again, I hope your realize how easy it is to make yourself look good by knocking someone else down. But, if that&#39;s the best you can do, so be it.</p>

<p>All the best,<br />Ephraim Schwartz<br />Editor-at-Large<br />InfoWorld</p>

                <p>Ephraim --</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.</p>

<p>I apologise for my swearypantsness.  As I state at the start of my post, your article made me very grumpy indeed.</p>

<p>I agree with you that it&#39;s &quot;unfair to hire people at a lower than prevailing wage because you can get away with it.&quot;  However, that was not my experience as an H1B employee.  In my five years as an H1B visa holder, I never once had an employer attempt to pay me lower than prevailing wage.  The starting salary I received on my first job was identical to that of US citizen college hires.</p>

<p>To my ears, the complaints are the grumblings of mediocre programmers who &quot;been discarded in middle age or later by large corporations&quot; (quote from their YahooGroups page) due to lack of skill, and are looking for someone to blame.  People who moved their way up the rungs at one company through The Peter Principle, and who are now unable to get rehired elsewhere at the level to which they&#39;re accustomed.</p>

<p>While it is certainly a program which can be, and I&#39;m sure *is*, abused, your claims that H1Bs are a source of &quot;cheap labor&quot; and that these statistics prove that &quot;almost everyone is abusing it&quot; seem to me to be ill-informed tosh and bunkum of the highest order.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re covered by a promise of confidentiality.  Could you perhaps answer this one question:  Did the statistics relating to salaries take into account years or levels of experience?</p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Rod.</p>

                <p>Well, to be fair, all this time you have been eating our food, *and* you had the audacity to fall in love with and marry an American woman, thus depriving some poor Yank his constitutional right to domestic female companionship. And by &quot;domestic&quot; I mean &quot;born and raised in the States&quot; and not in any perjorative sense that would cause Joy to punch me. Hard. </p>

<p>That said, based on their website it looks like a report from the Programmers&#39; Guild on H1B visas would be as unbiased as, say, Air America&#39;s coverage of the Republican National Convention. </p>
