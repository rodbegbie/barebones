            <h2>Occasionally Asked Questions</h2>
                	<h3>&#8220;Groovy mother&#8221;...?  Are you a mother?</h3>

	<p>No, although I am undeniably groovy.  My dangly parts are in my shorts, rather than in my shirt, so gestation is rather out of the question.</p>

	<p>The site name originates from a banner I made, back when I worked for [Anagram Of Panties].  I was working on a fairly dull healthcare project for a state government. The team working on it was a group I still consider to be the greatest team I&#8217;ve ever worked with &#8211; sharp, funny, and a blatant disregard for normality.  I made a banner that hung outside our team area that proudly boasted &#8220;MCSYS: The grooviest bunch of mothers ever to chum up in the name of Managed Care&#8221;.</p>

	<p>(This was followed by a neighbouring team printing a banner that said &#8220;Yeah, <span class="caps">MCSYS</span>.. But Who&#8217;s Your Daddy?&#8221;  Oh, the japes we had.)</p>

	<p>I quite like the term &#8220;groovy mother&#8221; (which was, at least subconsciously I think, inspired by the famed Jools Holland &#8220;groovy fuckers&#8221; <a href="http://www.channel4.com/music/microsites/0-9/4radio/thetube/about_the_tube.html">debacle</a>), and over time performed such acts as changing my email address in the corporate mail server to groovymother@sapient.com.</p>

	<p>So one time when I was buying a couple of domain names a few years back, I chucked groovymother.com into my metaphorical cart, and this is where I&#8217;ve been blogging since April 2002.</p>

	<p>(For the longest time, I rather innocently had no idea that anyone would be confused and think that I really was a mother.  When this was pointed out to me, I slammed my avatar onto the homepage.  Hopefully that bearded image should cancel any misapprehensions sharpish.)</p>

	<h3>And what&#8217;s an &#8220;arsecandle&#8221;?</h3>

	<p>Ah, that originates with the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29" title="Chris Morris - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Chris Morris</a>.</p>

	<p>In a sketch in the first episode of his seminal TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Eye" title="Brass Eye - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Brass Eye</a>, there is the tale told of a crazed man harrasing a local cow who is his landlord.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><em>VOICEOVER: Ted Maul</em><br />TM: &#8220;But last June out of nowhere, anti-cow slogans started appearing on the sheds.&#8221;<br /><em>(SLOGAN: &#8220;Cowe gonna Be chopps&#8221;)</em><br />TM: &#8220;The text specifically designed to undermine the cows&#8217; confidence.&#8221;<br /><em>(SLOGAN: &#8220;<span class="caps">DONT</span> <span class="caps">LOOK</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> COW&#8221; &#8211; a train is pictured travelling towards a cow)</em><br />TM: &#8220;Local press caught whiff of a weird-one when the vandal shot his paint straight at the cow in the form of words like &#8220;twat&#8221;, and later &#8220;fucknut&#8221; and &#8220;arsecandle&#8221;, as the campaign plunged into overdrive. Next came a wave of sick attachments &#8211; cow attached to a filing cabinet -&#8221;<br /><em>(A cow chained to a filing cabinet is shown)</em><br />TM: &#8220;- cow attached to a Mini engine in a shopping trolley.&#8221;<br /><em>(A cow chained to a shopping trolley, Mini engine inside)</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>For whatever reason, the word &#8220;arsecandle&#8221; stuck with me &#8212; it&#8217;s just a lovely evocative combination of sounds from an obscure throwaway gag.</p>

	<p>To this day, I still use &#8220;Arsecandle Industries, Inc.&#8221; whenever I had to fill in a form which requires a company name.</p>

	<h3>Why doesn&#8217;t your Atom feed link directly to sites you link to?</h3>

	<p>It does.  Your feedreader&#8217;s just not showing you.  In accordance with the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/06/16/dive.html" title="XML.com: The Atom Link Model">Atom best practices</a>, my feed includes a permalink here on groovymother.com, in addition to the page I&#8217;m linking to.  If your feedreader is only showing the former, pester the author and ask them to fix it to show &#8220;related&#8221; links too in accordance with the Atom standard.</p>

	<h3>Where did you make your avatar?</h3>

	<p>That was created many moons ago with the <a href="http://www.dookyweb.com/index.php?seccion=avatars">Gorillaz avatar maker</a></p>

	<h3>What is the air-speed velocity of a&#8230;</h3>

	<p>Oh, don&#8217;t be so tedious.</p>
