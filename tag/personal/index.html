        <h4>Eulogy for the Clydester</h4>
        <p>A moments silence, if you will, for Horatio Clyde Begbie. 1996&#8211;2010.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/3510373261/"; title="It's all in the eyes by RodBegbie, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3594/3510373261_537461a99e.jpg"; width="500" height="333" alt="It's all in the eyes" /></a>

<p>Clyde joined our household in 2006 via the good folks at <a href="http://www.newenglandbassethoundrescue.org/" title="New England Basset Hound Rescue - Home">New England Basset Hound Rescue</a>. His previous owners were moving and unable to take Clyde with them.</p>

<p>A friendlier, lazier, more perfect-for-the-Begbie-family dog you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find.</p>

<p>Clyde quickly became &#8220;my&#8221; dog. Wherever I was in the house was where he wanted to hang out. When I moved to SF three months ahead of Joy and the dogs, he spent a lot of time in the front hall waiting for me to come home. Indeed, when I had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/2443866465/" title="Video Chat with Clyde on Flickr">iChat video conferences with Joy</a> and he heard my voice, he&#8217;d go barreling to the front door to greet me.</p>

<p>Clyde was an old soul when we got him, so to some degree we were always semi-prepared for the time when be would no longer be with us. Every day he was in our lives was bonus time for a dog who had already lived a pretty full life before he became a Begbie.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a fairly rational sort. I hold little truck for concepts like rainbow bridges. At this time, I am instead comforted by three-and-a-bit years of memories of one of the sweetest, most loving, and endearingly stubborn hounds ever to lounge around this planet.</p>

<p><span class="caps">RIP</span> Clyde.  You shall be missed.</p>

        <h4>No taxation without representation</h4>
        <p>I&#8217;m a political junkie.  Election night is like my Superbowl&#8212;Watching the results trickle in, cheering on my &#8220;team&#8221;.</p>

<p>Which makes it odd that, aged 30, I have only twice in my life cast a vote in a political race, and the only time I did so by visiting a voting booth was in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_referendum%2C_1997" title="Scotland referendum, 1997 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">referendum</a> rather than an election.  (In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">1997</a>, I was a student in Edinburgh, and cast my vote by proxy for my hometown MP whose seat was more marginal.)</p>

<p>Shortly after moving to the US eight years ago, I attempted to get my name onto the British electoral register as an overseas voter, but due to a screw-up by the registrar in Stirling I failed.  Since then I haven&#8217;t bothered trying again as the new rules for registering as an overseas voter are too much hassle (involving finding a British citizen to whom I am not related).  Besides, overseas voters can only vote in General Elections, not local or Scottish ones, so I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m missing out on much and have just resorted to trundling along as a disenfranchised soul, grumbling occasionally about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation" title="No taxation without representation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">taxation without representation</a>.</p>

<p>But today, I was looking at the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/" title="USCIS Home Page">US Immigration Services</a> site, and realised that I will be able to apply for American citizenship in January of 2008.  The naturalization process reportedly takes an average of six months so, theoretically, it is possible that I will get to have a say (beyond trying to convince Joy how to vote) in the 2008 presidential election.</p>

<p>(As an aside, only a true child would be amused by the fact that the final page of the official <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/M-476_English.pdf">Guide to Naturalization</a>, in an appendix giving examples of the kind of sentence you might have to write in your citizenship test to prove your English-speaking abilities, includes the sentence &#8220;The colors of the fag <i>(sic)</i> are red, white and blue.&#8221;)</p>

<p>But for now, I&#8217;m sat on the sofa with a beer, refreshing <span class="caps">CNN</span>.com every so often and cheering as the Democrats steal seats in the Senate, and just enjoying waiting for the victory speech from our new Governor Elect, the splendid <a href="http://www.devalpatrick.com/" title="Deval Patrick, Democrat for Governor of Massachusetts">Deval Patrick</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> And today is my extra innings.  The bases are loaded, and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/VA/S/01/" title="CNN.com - Elections 2006">Webb</a>&#8216;s at the plate.  Fantastic!</p>
