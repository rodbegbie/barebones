        <h4>Going Offline</h4>
        	<p>[TL;DR: I&#8217;m starting something awesome, go and <a href="http://offlinelabs.com/fandf/">sign up for our mailing list</a> to be the first to find out about it]</p>

	<p>On August 1st 2010, I was an Engineering Manager with Slide.  On September 17th 2010, I am leaving my role as Member of Technical Staff at Google to co-found my own startup.</p>

	<p>What a difference a month can make! </p>

	<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rodbegbie/statuses/21096036383" class="img"><img src="http://static.groovymother.com/images/augusttweet.JPG" alt="" width="607" height="332" /></a></p>

 <hr/>

	<p>First, an important statement that I can&#8217;t emphasize enough: <strong>This is not a reaction to the Slide acquisition.</strong>  No-one should attempt to spin this as &#8220;Rod didn&#8217;t want to work for Google, so quit.&#8221;  If anything, the opportunities presented by being part of Google made the decision to leave considerably harder.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m leaving behind an incredible team who I know are going to kick 41 shades of ass, and I&#8217;ll be standing in the crowds cheering them all the way.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/4933088521/" title="Mr. Nolte will see you now by RodBegbie, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4933088521_6aec9a147e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mr. Nolte will see you now" /></a></p>

 <hr/>

	<p>So two questions that need answering: 1) What are we going to build? and 2) Why now?  Let&#8217;s answer the latter first.</p>

	<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>

	<p>For years, I&#8217;ve stated that my goal in life was to find someone with great ideas, then be their technical co-founder.  I know my limits — I am not someone who can come up with blue-sky ideas out of thin air — but also my strengths — I can take someone else&#8217;s great concept and nitpick, tweak, enhance, argue and generally make it much more awesomer.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve worked with Rishi for close to two years and we have a great working relationship.  He&#8217;s the product guy, I&#8217;m the engineer-with-product-guy-tendencies.  When we started chatting over coffee one day about ideas for potential startups, one in particular immediately clicked with me.  I got excited and hand-wavey about ways it could expand; ways to shift the focus to make it more powerful to solve problems I know that my friends and I have faced.</p>

	<p>Initially, I said I&#8217;d be happy to be an advisor to Rishi if he decided to work further on it.  But as I described the idea to Joy one evening, she called my bluff.  I kept saying things like &#8220;Our idea is…&#8221;, or &#8220;What we would do is…&#8221;  She pointed out that I was more bought in than I was letting on to myself. So I emailed Rishi and said I was in.</p>

	<p><img src="http://static.groovymother.com/images/rishi-im.JPG" alt="" width="492" height="112" /></p>

	<p>So why now? Because we have a great idea, a killer team, and it&#8217;s so easy these days. Starting a web software firm is practically free — Between open-source software platforms, dirt-cheap virtual server &#8220;cloud&#8221; hosting, and a squillion online services that handle the tricky parts for $25/month, not to mention being in a city surrounded by entrepreneurial sorts who are happy to give advice, it&#8217;s almost harder <em>not to</em> start your own thing!</p>

	<p><strong>What are we going to build?</strong></p>

	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/4984019271/" title="Offline Labs business cards by RodBegbie, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4984019271_122f8cdd9b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Offline Labs business cards" /></a></p>

	<p>So we have an idea, a team, a <a href="http://offlinelabs.com/">company name</a>, a two-month bootstrapping plan, and sheer damned determination; but what are we building?</p>

	<p>At this point, I have to turn a tad coy in such a public venue since we&#8217;re still at an early stage, but the crux of it: Building online tools that make it easier for people to <strong>find things to do, find friends to do them with, and keep track of the memories</strong> after the fact.</p>

	<p>Social software like Twitter and Facebook has made it vastly more easy to keep track of our friends online.  We want to flip this on its head and use everyone&#8217;s newly-formed online connections to make it simpler to find things to do, in the real world.  Y&#8217;know… &#8220;offline&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Sounds intriguing, <em>non</em>? You&#8217;re left desperately wanting to know more details, <em>oui</em>?  Then hop over post-haste to our <a href="http://offlinelabs.com/fandf/">exclusive limited-time friends-and-family mailing list signup page</a>.  That&#8217;ll be the first place we share our plans, thoughts, and prototypes, and just giving us your email address will be a hugely-appreciated show of support.</p>

	<p>And if you want more details sooner, offer to buy me coffee or a beer. I&#8217;m a poor bootstrapping type now, and will excitedly bend the ear and pick the brain of anyone who offers me liquid refreshment.</p>

 <hr/>

	<p>So here I go, putting my money where my mouth is, jumping in feet first, dropping the english muffin into the start-up toaster and seeing if it pops up hot & buttered…  Wish me luck!</p>
