        <h4>Eulogy for the Clydester</h4>
        <p>A moments silence, if you will, for Horatio Clyde Begbie. 1996&#8211;2010.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/3510373261/"; title="It's all in the eyes by RodBegbie, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3594/3510373261_537461a99e.jpg"; width="500" height="333" alt="It's all in the eyes" /></a>

<p>Clyde joined our household in 2006 via the good folks at <a href="http://www.newenglandbassethoundrescue.org/" title="New England Basset Hound Rescue - Home">New England Basset Hound Rescue</a>. His previous owners were moving and unable to take Clyde with them.</p>

<p>A friendlier, lazier, more perfect-for-the-Begbie-family dog you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find.</p>

<p>Clyde quickly became &#8220;my&#8221; dog. Wherever I was in the house was where he wanted to hang out. When I moved to SF three months ahead of Joy and the dogs, he spent a lot of time in the front hall waiting for me to come home. Indeed, when I had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/groovymother/2443866465/" title="Video Chat with Clyde on Flickr">iChat video conferences with Joy</a> and he heard my voice, he&#8217;d go barreling to the front door to greet me.</p>

<p>Clyde was an old soul when we got him, so to some degree we were always semi-prepared for the time when be would no longer be with us. Every day he was in our lives was bonus time for a dog who had already lived a pretty full life before he became a Begbie.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a fairly rational sort. I hold little truck for concepts like rainbow bridges. At this time, I am instead comforted by three-and-a-bit years of memories of one of the sweetest, most loving, and endearingly stubborn hounds ever to lounge around this planet.</p>

<p><span class="caps">RIP</span> Clyde.  You shall be missed.</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve spent the past two evenings on Tony&#39;s  laptop - on neighbor&#39;s borrowed power - looking at scores of photos and comments so lovingly posted, about the Basset boys.  I paid special attention to anything &quot;Clyde&quot;.  I smiled at him hanging over the sides of an undersized doggie bed, admired numerous pictures of his most impressive drool, and shed some tears while viewing several shots that captured Clyde&#39;s noble profile, his sweet,gentle face and expressive eyes.  I can imagine the void in your life that his passing creates, and share with you the loss of Horatio Clyde Begbie.  He was one very fine and classy Basset hound, who enriched all our lives, who endeared himself to everyone with his good nature, and who had &quot;a courtly manner and gleaming eye for the tall girls&quot;.  Clyde will be missed, and remembered with great fondness.<br />For now, comfort each other and cuddle up with Bacon.  As I write this, Maggie is snuggled up next to me - and I am aware there is little else more comforting than the warmth of a snoring (and occasionally farting) dog beside you! <br />Love you all three!<br />        Mom</p>

                <p>Rod<br />I am so very sorry to hear about Clyde.<br />Even though you say that you were semi prepared because he was a senior hound when he came to you, it doesn&#39;t make it any less difficult.<br />The basset seems leave extra large paw prints on your heart due to their loving and sweet nature.<br />I&#39;ll tell Abigail to keep an eye out for him, show him the ropes up in doggy heaven ;)<br />Peace</p>

                <p>(My computer decided to send that post before I finished!)<br />...Bacon had a pal. That was a lot of basset in your place here and the shots of the two of them running around in SF were wonderful to see. So sorry to hear he is gone but his memories will stay with you and Joy forever.</p>
