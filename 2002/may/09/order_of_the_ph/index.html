It gives me more time to finally get around to finishing the fourth one.</p>

                <p>SPOILER!!!</p>

<p>The death of Sirius may have been an act of euthanasia. By killing of Sirius however, you allow more room for Harry&#39;s feelings. The death scene was very simple, so some believe that he may be back. There is a rumor that Harry may die in the seventh book. However, before then I hope Rowling doesn&#39;t end up killing off any more characters like Lupin, the Weaslys or Hagrid. The plot ended up in the same position as the last book, and it aslo became a little repititive in the final showdown. &quot;jets of light&quot;. As for the revelation, Neville could very well be the other person in the phrophecy, so I think he will play a bigger role in the future books. I was also glad that Rowling introduced some more characters. Cant wait for the next one. </p>

                <p>I was dissappointed in OOTP.  JK was not up to her best.  The work appears rushed and forced.</p>

<p>The first half of the book was rather monotonous and lacking in the usual charm of her work.  It could have been considerably shorter.  One was so bored by the second half that, although more interesting, it was hard to keep interested.</p>

<p>The big revelation was a big non-event.  Everyone has known since the first book that eventually a showdown would occur between Vodimort and Harry.  Dumbledore didn&#39;t really tell us much.  It certainly wasn&#39;t worth reading a very large book to find out.</p>

<p>However, want I think I found most dissappointing was that the amount of witty discourse between the main characters of Harry, Ron, &amp; Hermione was not as much as needed.  That which was used was good, but not enough.  I like the verbal interplay between these characters - needs more in the next novel.</p>
