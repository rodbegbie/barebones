        <p><a href="http://www.craphound.com/" title="Cory Doctorow's Literary Works">Cory Doctorow</a> has written <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/correcting_the_recor.html" title="Boing Boing: Correcting the Record: Wikipedia vs The Register">an entry</a> comparing his differing experiences getting facts corrected in articles on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/" title="The Register: Sci/Tech News for the World">The Register</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Rough summary:  Because Cory could edit Wikipedia himself, the corrections were made sooner (although at the expense of plenty of his time) than when he had to phone up The Register and get someone to change the page manually.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the site, The Register is an online publication published by a limited liability company, written by professional writers, and funded by advertising.  It has a reputation for acerbic. humerous and opinionated writing around topics of interest to geeks.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that Boing Boing has a history of screwing things up.  Often they&#8217;ll put an update at the bottom of the article as a correction, but they (and Cory in particular) are often guilty of shoot-first ask-questions-later attacks.</p>

<p>Boing Boing is an online publication published by a limited liability company, written by professional writers, and funded by advertising.  It has a reputation for acerbic. humerous and opinionated writing around topics of interest to geeks.</p>

<p>Compare the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=http://www.theregister.co.uk/&amp;y=r&amp;url=www.boingboing.net" title="Related Info for: boingboing.net/">traffic for The Reg and BoingBoing</a>&#8212;pretty similar.  And Bloglines reports that BoingBoing has readership of ~38,000 to El Reg&#8217;s ~15,000.</p>

<p>Fuck-ups, character attacks, and underinformed rants by Cory et al are just as dangerous to the world at large, and this smug attack on The Register is just an excellent example.  Hell, at least ye olde newspapers have a &#8220;Letters&#8221; page to allow readers a right-to-reply.</p>

<p>Perhaps Cory could learn a thing or two from the fourth estate.  BoingBoing could get themselves a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/readerseditor/" title="Guardian Unlimited | Readers editor | Guardian readers editor">readers blogger</a> to handle complaints, rather than rely on their own judgement on what deserves sharing.  Maybe then, he could claim any level of superiority over other online publications.</p>

                <p>I think you&#39;re being a little unfair to Cory here. The foci of his complaint with The Reg &amp; Andrew are:<br />1: Their attacks on the reliability of Wikipedia<br />2: Lack of proper fact-checking<br />3: Their slackness in posting corrections</p>

<p>BB isn&#39;t guilty of either 1 or 3; it loves Wikipedia and posts fairly rapid updates to stories. It&#39;s bang to rights on 2, but then (so Cory implies) the main problem with 2 is 3.</p>

<p>Cory describing Andrew&#39;s journalism as &quot;ready, fire, aim&quot; *is* somewhat hypocritical given BB&#39;s record, but BB does at least post rapid corrections.</p>

                <p>My personal experience when sending corrections to Cory has been:</p>

<p>* Send detailed email explaining where I think his argument is flawed</p>

<p>* Receive back snippy one-liner email which reiterates his personal blinkered view on the world.</p>

<p>And fair enough -- it&#39;s his blog, and they haven&#39;t accepted comments in years.  I just post a snotty link in my linkblog and the world continues turning.</p>

<p>But it does leave me wondering how many stories on Ver Boing go uncorrected.  I certainly apply a much-more cynical bullshit-filter to my reading of the blog these days.</p>

                <p>You might mistake snippy for incredibly incredibly time-limited. Cory replies to all his emails, which if you&#39;ve ever seen his inbox is FUCKING TERRIFYING.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that there&#39;s a couple of levels of extra yummy delicious irony in the piece, (I pointed one out to him, in that while saying that people who refer to themselves in the third person look foolish, BB nevertheless has a policy of doing that in blog entries). But I don&#39;t think they detract from the main point, which is that it&#39;s Orlowski can&#39;t actively attack wikipedia with his own problems. Cory&#39;s conclusion - that we all have to find the truth, sounds pretty much the same conclusion you came to.</p>

                <p>Nice post Rod.<br />I was having very similar thoughts as you when I read that particular piece on boingboing.<br />Then I thought.. how many people really care about that crap anyhow? And how many knew about it before Cory started having a breakdown about it? I think a post like that should have been filed on his personal site perhaps, as I found it stuck out badly on boingboing.<br />Although its not really about anything important, here is a blatant example of shoot first ask later.
